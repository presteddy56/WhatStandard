      "was undertaken in order to incorporate new evidence and to update the recommendations where appropriate. A consensus meeting involving experts in depressive disorders and their management was held in September 2012. Key areas in treating depression were reviewed and the strength of evidence and clinical implications were considered. The guidelines were then revised after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. A literature review is provided which identifies the quality of evidence upon which the recommendations are made. These guidelines cover the nature and detection of depressive disorders, acute treatment with antidepressant drugs, choice of drug versus alternative treatment, practical issues in prescribing and management, next-step treatment, relapse prevention, treatment of relapse and stopping treatment. Significant changes since the last guidelines were published in 2008 include the availability of new antidepressant treatment options, improved evidence supporting certain augmentation strategies (drug and non-drug), management of potential long-term side effects, updated guidance for prescribing in elderly and adolescent populations and updated guidance for optimal prescribing.' has dtype incompatible with float64, please explicitly cast to a compatible dtype first.\n",

Examples of these include connections with the neuroendocrine axis, in particular, the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) that subserves responses to stress, and which in addition to being modulated by hormonal processes, is subject to autonomic nervous system control. Changes in the latter, and more specifically cardiac changes related to parasympathetic and sympathetic tone, can also modify inputs to the brain. A key region that is important to emotional processing and subject to many of these inputs, and itself provides outputs to many networks within the brain, is the hippocampus. The schematic shows the emergence of cells that begin as stem cells under the influence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The generation of new cells and the many steps involved are all subject to influences such as those from proinflammatory cytokines that can diminish neurogenesis, neural integrity and reduce dendritic sprouting, thereby diminishing the functional capacity of the hippocampus. These types of changes within the brain that are driven by stress are thought to underpin the emergence of emotional disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder. In addition, neural networks involved in emotional regulation and processing of emotion play a significant role, as do intrinsic biological factors that contribute to the development of necessary neural structures. Psychosocial and environmental factors are thus able to impact these complex systems and their sophisticated interactions, and it is disruptions within these that ultimately lead to changes that are reflected as clinical symptomatology of mood disorders.24 ANZJP Articles\n",

This can be aided by the use of questionnaires which can be self-report or clinician-administered. However, in order to arrive at a diagnosis, a threshold needs to be determined. Focusing on symptoms alone, a diagnosis can be made based on the specifications set out in classificatory systems such as DSM-5 and ICD (see section 2, ‘Classification’). However, these are summated rather crudely, and the diagnosis does not convey sufficient meaningful information regarding the clinical profile of the individual. To enhance the diagnostic usefulness of the clinical symptoms, they may be grouped according to the ACE model (see ‘Ace model’ in section 2), which provides an indication of which domains are most affected. This model also ensures a broader perspective is maintained and allows for the possibility that the main problem areas concern activity and/or cognition and not just emotion. Adding a further layer of sophistication, symptoms can be rated in terms of severity and the extent to which they impact functioning, that is, the degree to which they impair activities the individual would normally be engaged in. Severity can be rated and communicated broadly as mild, moderate or severe, indicating to some degree the acuity of the illness and the urgency with which treatment is needed. The diagnosis can be further nuanced by considering whether the symptoms at the level of syn-dromes form specific subtypes such as anxious distress or melancholia.

On the other hand, the telehealth modality is still emerging: Digitally mediated and in-person consultations clearly have contrasting strengths, and new hybrid models of care will soon be sub-jected to rigorous tests (Smith et al., 2020).
