      "A revision of the 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology evidence-based guidelines for treating depressive disorders with antidepressants \n",
      "was undertaken in order to incorporate new evidence and to update the recommendations where appropriate. A consensus meeting involving experts in depressive disorders and their management was held in September 2012. Key areas in treating depression were reviewed and the strength of evidence and clinical implications were considered. The guidelines were then revised after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. A literature review is provided which identifies the quality of evidence upon which the recommendations are made. These guidelines cover the nature and detection of depressive disorders, acute treatment with antidepressant drugs, choice of drug versus alternative treatment, practical issues in prescribing and management, next-step treatment, relapse prevention, treatment of relapse and stopping treatment. Significant changes since the last guidelines were published in 2008 include the availability of new antidepressant treatment options, improved evidence supporting certain augmentation strategies (drug and non-drug), management of potential long-term side effects, updated guidance for prescribing in elderly and adolescent populations and updated guidance for optimal prescribing.' has dtype incompatible with float64, please explicitly cast to a compatible dtype first.\n",

Second, the focus of these guidelines is clinical management (i.e. treatment managed by clinicians such as psychiatrists, GPs and clinical psycholo-gists), but such management occurs in the context of other determinants of mental health and well-being, including the important role played by carers, family and social support networks and services.\n",

Clearly, the number and variety of these factors precludes detailed analysis and at many points the guidelines simply emphasise the clinical importance of individualised case formu-lation and the use of practice-based evidence to inform personalised care (see also MDcpg\n",

Examples of these include connections with the neuroendocrine axis, in particular, the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) that subserves responses to stress, and which in addition to being modulated by hormonal processes, is subject to autonomic nervous system control. Changes in the latter, and more specifically cardiac changes related to parasympathetic and sympathetic tone, can also modify inputs to the brain. A key region that is important to emotional processing and subject to many of these inputs, and itself provides outputs to many networks within the brain, is the hippocampus. The schematic shows the emergence of cells that begin as stem cells under the influence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The generation of new cells and the many steps involved are all subject to influences such as those from proinflammatory cytokines that can diminish neurogenesis, neural integrity and reduce dendritic sprouting, thereby diminishing the functional capacity of the hippocampus. These types of changes within the brain that are driven by stress are thought to underpin the emergence of emotional disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder. In addition, neural networks involved in emotional regulation and processing of emotion play a significant role, as do intrinsic biological factors that contribute to the development of necessary neural structures. Psychosocial and environmental factors are thus able to impact these complex systems and their sophisticated interactions, and it is disruptions within these that ultimately lead to changes that are reflected as clinical symptomatology of mood disorders.24 ANZJP Articles\n",

This can be aided by the use of questionnaires which can be self-report or clinician-administered. However, in order to arrive at a diagnosis, a threshold needs to be determined. Focusing on symptoms alone, a diagnosis can be made based on the specifications set out in classificatory systems such as DSM-5 and ICD (see section 2, ‘Classification’). However, these are summated rather crudely, and the diagnosis does not convey sufficient meaningful information regarding the clinical profile of the individual. To enhance the diagnostic usefulness of the clinical symptoms, they may be grouped according to the ACE model (see ‘Ace model’ in section 2), which provides an indication of which domains are most affected. This model also ensures a broader perspective is maintained and allows for the possibility that the main problem areas concern activity and/or cognition and not just emotion. Adding a further layer of sophistication, symptoms can be rated in terms of severity and the extent to which they impact functioning, that is, the degree to which they impair activities the individual would normally be engaged in. Severity can be rated and communicated broadly as mild, moderate or severe, indicating to some degree the acuity of the illness and the urgency with which treatment is needed.

It is also important to assess for the possibility of psychosis and cognitive changes including any moderation of insight. Following a detailed assessment of mental state and behav-iour it is important to ensure that there is close clinical supervision including ongoing regular monitoring.

Therefore, from a psychological perspective, the inpatient treatment of mania should emphasise relationship building with the patient, and psychoeducation with the family (Chen et al., 2019b).

This includes risk to self and others, and an appraisal needs to be made of future risky decision making that may, for example, impact the individual’s reputation. In addition, it is important to assess the individual’s insight and also determine whether they are experiencing acute psychotic symptoms in the context of mania. This again will determine whether other Actions are possible and what treatments can be implemented and in which setting this is most appropriate. Assuming the individual is accepting of management strategies and amenable to persuasion, it is important to institute measures that reduce arousal, provide structure and routine, limit activity and ensure restoration of normal sleep.

To overcome these problems the term difficult-to-treat depression (DTD) has been proposed with two main advantages (McAllister-Williams et al., 2020): first, unlike TRD, the description ‘difficult to treat’ suggests that the management of the depressive illness is likely to be challenging but at the same time it is not totally unachievable. In other words, the depression is not completely resistant (refractory) per se. Second, the definition of DTD is not predicated on pharmacotherapy alone, and the management of DTD involves a much broader set of strategies – including, for example, psychosocial measures.

Difficult to treat depression (DTD) and treatment resistant depression (TRD are predicated on non-response. Both paradigms require a threshold, namely that of non-response, either of specific agents or a number of strategies. For DTD, the threshold is lower, and the depression is regarded as ‘challenging’ after the very first treatment failure. For TRD the focus is principally on pharmacotherapy, although some aspects of the definitions also include physical treatments and the threshold is usually 2 or more treatment failures. In contrast, the channelling response paradigm (CRP) runs alongside the treatment of depression throughout and is a perspective that is adopted from the outset. Thus, the CRP has no threshold and there is no focus on treatment failures. Instead, the focus is on responsivity, and depression is conceptualised as an amalgam of responsivities to different types of treatment. Therefore, the CRP automatically instils a positive outlook whereas DTD and TRD are prone to generate a negative perspective. Malhi et al. 91\n",

More broadly, it is important for clinicians to be sensitive to the developmental context of adolescent BD, ensuring treatment is meaningful to the young person (Murray, 2019b).
