      "The American Psychological Association developed this clinical practice \n",
      "guideline to provide recommendations for the treatment of depressive \n",
      "disorders (including major depression, subsyndromal depression, and per -\n",
      "sistent depressive disorder). It addresses three developmental cohorts: \n",
      "children and adolescents; general adults; and older adults (ages 60 and \n",
      "over). Ten systematic reviews and meta-analyses, along with other litera -\n",
      "ture and observations from practitioners and patients, served as the basis \n",
      "for the guideline. The guideline development panel consisted of health \n",
      "professionals from psychology, psychiatry, and primary care as well as \n",
      "community members who self-identified as having had depression. The \n",
      "panel examined the efficacy of psychological treatments and of comple -\n",
      "mentary and alternative medicine treatments.  It also examined compara -\n",
      "tive effectiveness among psychological treatments (by themselves and in \n",
      "combination with pharmacotherapy) and comparative effectiveness of \n",
      "psychological treatments in relation to pharmacotherapy and to comple -\n",
      "mentary and alternative treatments. The panel made no treatment recom-mendations specific to children but did make recommendations for \n",
      "treatment of depression in adolescents, adults, and older adults. These \n",
      "recommendations are detailed in the guideline.\n",
      "Keywords: Depression; clinical practice guideline; best practices\n",
      "INTENDED USE OF GUIDELINE\n",
      "This guideline is intended to be aspirational and is not intended to create a \n",
      "requirement for practice. It is not intended to limit scope of practice in \n",
      "licensing laws for psychologists or for other independently licensed profes -\n",
      "sionals, nor limit coverage for reimbursement by third party payers. Nor is \n",
      "the guideline intended to be used within a legal or judicial context to imply that psychologists or other independently licensed professionals are \n",
      "required to comply with any of its recommendations. \n",
      "The term guideline  refers to statements that suggest or recommend \n",
      "specific professional behavior, endeavor, or conduct for psychologists \n",
      "and may be useful for other clinicians. Guidelines differ from standards \n",
      "in that standards are mandatory and may be accompanied by an enforce -\n",
      "ment mechanism. Thus, guidelines are aspirational in intent. They are \n",
      "intended to facilitate the continued systematic development of the pro -\n",
      "fession and to help assure a high level of professional practice by psy -\n",
      "chologists. Guidelines are not intended to be mandatory or exhaustive \n",
      "and may not be applicable to every professional and clinical situation. \n",
      "They are not definitive, and they are not intended to take precedence \n",
      "over the judgment of psychologists. Please refer to the APA’s (2015a) \n",
      "Professional Practice Guidelines: Guidance for Developers and Users for a \n",
      "discussion of the several types of guidelines produced by APA. Clinical \n",
      "practice guidelines are an important tool for determining intervention \n",
      "options but are not the only resource.\n",
      "Clinicians are encouraged to consider the report from the APA \n",
      "Presidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice (APA, 2006), \n",
      "Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology , which emphasizes the integration \n",
      "of best available research; patient characteristics, culture, and preferenc -\n",
      "es; and clinical expertise for making treatment decisions. \n",
      "In reviewing the recommendation statements, the panel reminds \n",
      "the reader that a lack of evidence about a treatment does not imply that that treatment is not efficacious. Rather, there are several gaps in the literature about treatments as well as limitations in the specific literature \n",
      "reviewed by the panel due to methodological constraints, as discussed \n",
      "later in the guideline document. Clinicians are encouraged to provide \n",
      "informed consent to patients.  \n",
      "INDIVIDUALIZING TREATMENT\n",
      "Clinicians strive to individualize treatments. So how might one follow \n",
      "evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, yet honor the individuality of patients? A comprehensive assessment can help identify factors that \n",
      "might require modifications to a treatment recommended by clinical practice guidelines. These include patient factors such as race; ethnicity; \n",
      "socioeconomic status; culture and/or heritage; or other features of their \n",
      "identities, values, or preferences.  In addition, the patient’s comorbidities, \n",
      "social support, and ability to obtain childcare when needed, as well as the \n",
      "clinician’s accessibility, location, hours of operation, available appoint -\n",
      "ments, proximity to public transportation, and other resources that can \n",
      "affect treatment, must be considered. Further, provider and setting fac -\n",
      "tors like constraints tied to duration of treatment, provider availability, or \n",
      "other factors will impact the application of a treatment recommended by \n",
      "a clinical practice guideline. Combining an individual assessment with the \n",
      "research summarized in the clinical practice guideline can help develop \n",
      "a conceptualization of the change processes that underpin the effective \n",
      "treatment to guide individualization decisions. This can promote “flex -\n",
