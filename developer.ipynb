It is \\nknown to be a major contributor to the global burden \\nof diseases and according to World Health Organization \\n(WHO), depression is the fourth leading cause of disability \\nworldwide and it is projected that by 2020, it will be \\nthe second most common leading cause of disability. \\nDepression is also associated with high rates of suicidal \\nbehaviour and mortality. When depression occurs in the \\ncontext of medical morbidity, it is associated with increased \\nhealth care cost, longer duration of hospitalization, poor \\ncooperation in treatment, poor treatment compliance and \\nhigh rates of morbidity. Depression is also known to be \\nassociated with difficulties in role transitions (e.g., low \\neducation, high teen child-bearing, marital disruption, \\nunstable  employment) and poor role functioning (e.g., \\nlow marital quality, low work performance, low earnings). \\nIt is also reported to be a risk factor for the onset and \\npersistence of a wide range of secondary disorders. \\nAvailable data also suggests that between one-third \\nand one-half of patients also experience recurrence of \\ndepressive episodes.

Evaluation of history also takes into consideration \\nthe relationship of onset of depression with change in \\nseason (seasonal affective disorder), peripartum period and \\nphase of menstrual cycle.  Further, the longitudinal course \\napproach may also take into account response to previous \\ntreatment and whether the patient achieved full remission, \\npartial remission and did not respond to treatment. \\nAn important aspect of diagnosis of depression is to rule \\nout bipolar disorder. Many patients with bipolar disorder \\npresent to the clinicians during the depressive phase of \\nillness and spontaneously do not report about previous \\nhypomanic or manic episodes. Careful history from the \\npatient and other sources (family members) often provide \\nimportant clues for the bipolar disorder. It is often useful to \\nuse standardized scales like mood disorder questionnaire to \\nrule out bipolarity. Treating a patient of bipolar depression \\nas unipolar disorder can increase the risk of antidepressant induced switch. Presence of psychotic features, marked \\npsychomotor retardation, reverse neurovegetative \\nsymptoms (excessive sleep and appetite), irritability of \\nmood, anger, family history of bipolar disorder and early \\nage of onset need to  alert the clinicians to evaluate for the \\npossibility of bipolar disorder, before concluding that they \\nare dealing with unipolar depression.  \\nArea to be covered in assessment include symptom \\ndimensions, symptom-severity, comorbid psychiatric and \\nmedical conditions, particularly comorbid substance abuse, \\nthe risk of harm to self or others, level of functioning and \\nthe socio-cultural milieu of the patient. \\nIn case patient has received treatment in the past, it is \\nimportant to evaluate the information in the form of type of \\nantidepressant used, dose of medication used, compliance \\nwith medication, reasons for poor compliance, reasons for \\nPatient with Depressive features\\nConsider differential diagnoses lik e\\n• Organic Depression, medication induced depression,\\n substance induced depression, premenstrual dysphoric\\n disorde r\\n• Rule out bipolar disorde r\\nEstablish the diagnosis of Depression\\nAssessment\\n• Severity of illness \\n• Risk of harm to self and others- current suicidal ideations, suicidal attempts ;\\n past history of non-suicidal self-harm behaviour, past history of suicidal attempts ,\\n severity of attempt\\n• Comorbid substance use/dependenc e\\n• Personality factor s\\n• Level of functioning- work dysfunction\\n• Detailed Physical examination- thyroid swelling, evidence for nutritional deficiency,\\n and physical illness which could contribute to depression\\n• Record- blood pressure, weight and wherever indicated body mass index and wais t\\n circumference\\n• Mental Status Examination\\n• Investigations- haemogram, liver function test, renal function test, fasting blood glucose level,\\n thyroid function test (if required), Urine pregnancy test (if required )\\n• Treatment history- response to previous medication trials, compliance, side effects, etc.\\n• Patient’s and caregivers beliefs about the cause of illness and beliefs about the treatment \\n• Assessment for social support, stigma, coping \\n• Assessment of caregiver burden, coping and distres s\\n• Decide about treatment setting - consider inpatient care in case of suicidality, malnutrition,\\n catatonia,  comorbid general medical conditions making management difficult at th e\\n outpatient setting\\n• Liaison with other specialists depending on the need of the patient  \\nPharmacological Management\\n• Choose an antidepressant based on pas t\\n treatment response, past history of side\\n effects, cost, comorbidity, patient/family\\n preference, availability Electroconvulsive therapy\\n• Catatonia, suicidality,\\n severe depression, pas t\\n response to ECT,\\n augmentation etc.Non-Pharmacological\\nManagement \\n• Psychoeducation \\n• Psychotherapeutic\\n intervention'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/clinical_practice_guidelines_for_the_management_of.11.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='• Catatonia, suicidality,\\n severe depression, pas t\\n response to ECT,\\n augmentation etc.Non-Pharmacological\\nManagement \\n• Psychoeducation \\n• Psychotherapeutic\\n intervention\\nFigure 1:  Initial evaluation and management plan for Depression \\nDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/indianjpsychiatry by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4\\nXMi0hCywCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC4/OAVpDDa8KKGKV0Ymy+78= on 09/18/2024'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/clinical_practice_guidelines_for_the_management_of.11.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Gautam, et al.: CPGs for depressionIndian J Psychiatry 59 (Supplement 1), January 2017 S37discontinuation of medication, response to treatment, side \\neffects experienced etc. If the medications were changed, \\nthen the reason for change is also to be evaluated. \\nWherever possible, unstructured assessments need to be \\nsupplemented by ratings on appropriate standardized \\nrating scales. Depending on the need, investigations \\nneed to be carried out.  The use of neuroimaging may be \\nindicated in those with first-episode of depression seen in \\nlate or very late age; those have neurological signs, those \\nhaving treatment resistant depression.\\nBesides, patients, information about the illness need to be \\nobtained from the caregivers too and their knowledge and \\nunderstanding of the illness, their attitudes and beliefs \\nregarding treatment, the impact of the illness on them and \\ntheir personal and social resources need to be evaluated.\\nFORMULATING A TREATMENT PLAN ( FIGURE -1)\\nFormulation of treatment plan involves deciding about \\ntreatment setting, medications and psychological treatments \\nto be used. Patients and caregivers may be actively consulted \\nwhile preparing the treatment plan. A practical, feasible and \\nflexible treatment plan can be formulated to address the needs \\nof the patients and caregivers. Further the treatment plan can \\nbe continuously re-evaluated and modified as required. \\nEV ALUATE THE SAFETY OF PATIENT AND \\nOTHERS\\nA careful assessment of the patient’s risk for suicide should \\nbe done. During history inquiry for the presence of suicidal \\nideation and other associated factors like presence of \\npsychotic symptoms, severe anxiety, panic attacks and \\nalcohol or substance abuse which increases the risk of suicide  \\nneed to  be evaluated. It has been found that severity of \\ndepressive symptomatology is a strong predictor of suicidal \\nideation over time in elderly patients. Evaluation also includes \\nhistory of past suicide attempts including the nature of those \\nattempts. Patients also need to be asked about suicide in their \\nfamily history. During the mental status examinations besides \\nenquiring about the suicidal ideations, it is also important to \\nenquire about the degree to which the patient intends to act \\non the suicidal ideation and the extent to which the patient has \\nmade plans or begun to prepare for suicide.  The availability \\nof means for suicide be inquired about and a judgment may \\nbe made concerning the lethality of those means. Patients \\nwho are found to possess suicidal or homicidal ideation, \\nintention or plans require close monitoring. Measures such as \\nhospitalization may be considered for those at significant risk. \\nCHOICE OF TREATMENT SETTINGS\\nMajority of the cases of depression seen in the clinical \\nsetting are of mild to moderate severity and can be managed at the outpatient setting. However, some patients have \\nsevere depression which may be further associated with \\npsychotic symptoms, catatonic symptoms, poor physical \\nhealth status, suicidal or homicidal behaviour etc. In such \\ncases, careful evaluation is to be done to decide about the \\ntreatment setting and whenever necessary inpatient care \\nmay be offered. In general, the rule of thumb is that the \\npatients may be treated in the setting that is most safe and \\neffective. Severely ill patients who lack adequate social \\nsupport outside of a hospital setting may be considered \\nfor admission to a hospital whenever feasible. The optimal \\ntreatment setting and the patient’s ability to benefit \\nfrom a different level of care may be re-evaluated on an \\nongoing basis throughout the course of treatment. Some \\nof the common indications for inpatient care are shown \\nin Table -4. \\nTable 4: Some indications for inpatient care during \\nacute episodes\\n• Presence of suicidal behaviour which puts the life of the patient at risk'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/clinical_practice_guidelines_for_the_management_of.11.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='in Table -4. \\nTable 4: Some indications for inpatient care during \\nacute episodes\\n• Presence of suicidal behaviour which puts the life of the patient at risk\\n• Refusal to eat which puts the life of patient at risk• Severe malnutrition• Catatonia•  Presence of general medical or comorbid psychiatric conditions that make outpatient treatment unsafe or ineffective\\nAll inpatients should have accompanying family caregivers. \\nIn case inpatient care facilities are not available, than the \\npatient and/or family need to be informed about such a \\nneed and admission in nearest available inpatient facility \\ncan be facilitated.  \\nTHERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE\\nIrrespective of the treatment modalities selected for \\npatients, it is important for the psychiatrist to establish a \\ntherapeutic alliance with the patient. A strong treatment \\nalliance between patient and psychiatrist is crucial for poorly \\nmotivated, pessimistic depressed patient who are sensitive \\nto side effect of medications. A positive therapeutic alliance \\nalways generates hope for good outcome.\\nENHANCED TREATMENT COMPLIANCE\\nThe successful treatment of major depressive disorder \\nrequires adequate compliance to treatment plan. Patients \\nwith depressive disorder may be poorly motivated and \\nunduly pessimistic over their chances of recovery with \\ntreatment. In addition, the side effect or requirements of \\ntreatment may lead to non-adherence. Patients are to be \\nencouraged to articulate any concern regarding adherence \\nand clinicians need to emphasize the importance of \\nadherence for successful treatment. Simple measures \\nwhich can help in improving the compliance are given in \\ntable -5.\\nDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/indianjpsychiatry by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4\\nXMi0hCywCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC4/OAVpDDa8KKGKV0Ymy+78= on 09/18/2024'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/clinical_practice_guidelines_for_the_management_of.11.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='Gautam, et al.: CPGs for depressionIndian J Psychiatry 59 (Supplement 1), January 2017 S38ADDRESS EARLY SIGNS OF RELAPSE\\nMany patients with depression experience relapse. \\nAccordingly, patients as well as their families if appropriate may be educated about the risk of relapse. They can be educated \\nto identify early signs and symptoms of new episodes.

Antidepressant medication may be used as \\ninitial treatment modality for patients with mild, moderate, \\nor severe depressive episode.  The selection of antidepressant \\nmedications may be based on patient specific and drug specific \\nfactors, as given in Table -7. In general, because of the side \\neffect and safety profile, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \\n(SSRIs) are considered to be the first line antidepressants. Other \\npreferred options include tricyclic antidepressants, mirtazapine, \\nbupropion, and venlafaxine. Usually the medication must be \\nstarted in the lower doses and the doses must be titrated, \\ndepending on the response and the side effects experienced. \\nDose and duration of antidepressants\\nPatients who have started taking an antidepressant \\nmedication should be carefully monitored to assess the response to pharmacotherapy as well as the emergence of \\nside effects and safety. Factors to consider when determining \\nthe frequency of monitoring include severity of illness, \\npatient’s co-operation with treatment, the availability of \\nsocial support and the presence of comorbid general medical \\nproblems. Visits may be kept frequent enough to monitor \\nand address suicidality and to promote treatment adherence. \\nImprovement with pharmacotherapy can be observed after \\n4-6 weeks of treatment. If at least a moderate improvement is \\nnot observed in this time period, reappraisal and adjustment \\nof the pharmacotherapy should be considered.\\nPsychotherapeutic interventions \\nA specific, effective psychotherapy may be considered \\nas an initial treatment modality for patients with mild to \\nmoderate depressive disorder. Clinical features that may \\nsuggest the use of a specific psychotherapy include the \\npresence of significant psychosocial stressors, intrapsychic \\nconflict and interpersonal difficulties. Patient’s preference \\nfor psychotherapeutic approaches is an important \\nfactor that may be considered in the decision to use \\npsychotherapy as the initial treatment modality. Pregnancy, \\nlactation, orthe wish to become pregnant may also be an \\nindication for psychotherapy as an initial treatment. Various \\npsychotherapeutic interventions which may be considered \\nbased on feasibility, expertise available and affordability are \\nshown in Table -8. \\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal \\ntherapy are the psychotherapeutic approaches that have the \\nbest documented efficacy in the literature for management \\nof depression. When psychodynamic psychotherapy is used \\nas specific treatment, in addition to symptom relief it is \\nfrequently with broader long term goals. \\nThe psychiatrist should take into account multiple \\nfactors when determining the frequency of sessions for \\nindividual patients, including the specific type and goals \\nof psychotherapy, the frequency necessary to create and \\nmaintain a therapeutic relationship, the frequency of visits \\nrequired to ensure treatment adherence, and the frequency \\nnecessary to monitor and address suicidality.

Regardless of the type of psychotherapy \\nselected, the patient’s response to treatment should be \\ncarefully monitored. For a given patient, time spent and \\nfrequency of visit may be decided by the psychiatrist.\\nPsychoeducation to the patient and, when appropriate, to \\nthe family\\nEducation concerning depression and its treatments can \\nbe provided to all patients. When appropriate, education \\ncan also be provided to involved family members. Specific \\neducational elements may be helpful in some circumstances, \\ne.g. that depression is a real illness and that effective \\ntreatments are both necessary and available may be crucial \\nfor patients who attribute their illness to a moral defect \\nor witch craft. Education regarding available treatment \\noptions will help patients make informed decisions, \\nanticipate side effects and adhere to treatments. Another \\nimportant aspect of providing education is informing the \\npatient and especially family about the lag period of onset \\nof action of antidepressants. Important components of \\npsychoeducation are given in Table -9. \\nCombination of pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy\\nThere is class of patients who may require the combination \\nof pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. In general, the \\nsame issues that influence the choice of medication or \\npsychotherapy when used alone should be considered \\nwhen choosing treatments for patients receiving combined \\ntherapy. \\nPHASES OF ILLNESS/TREATMENT\\nManagement of depression can be broadly divided into three \\nphases, i.e., acute phase, continuation phase and maintenance \\nphase. Maintenance phase of treatment is usually considered \\nwhen patient has recurrent depressive disorder.  ACUTE PHASE TREATMENT\\nThe goal of acute phase treatment is to achieve remission, \\nas presence of residual symptoms increase the risk of \\nchronic depression, poor quality of life and also impairs \\nrecovery from physical illness. Treatment generally results \\nin improvement in quality of life and better functional \\ncapacity.

Selection of an \\ninitial treatment modality is usually influenced by both \\nclinical (e.g. severity of symptoms) and other factors \\n(e.g. patient preference). \\nAntidepressant medication may be used as initial treatment \\nmodality for patients with mild, moderate, or severe major \\ndepressive disorder. Clinical features that may suggest that \\nmedication are the preferred treatment modality includes \\nhistory of prior positive response to antidepressant \\nmedication, severity of symptoms, significant sleep and \\nappetite disturbance,  agitation, or anticipation of the need \\nfor maintenance therapy. Patients with severe depression \\nwith psychotic features will require use of combination of \\nantidepressant and antipsychotic medication and/or ECT.\\nThe initial selection of an antidepressant medication is \\nlargely be based on the anticipated side effects, the safety \\nor tolerability of these side effects for individual patients, \\npatient preference and comorbid physical illnesses. \\nDose and duration of antidepressants:  Once an \\nantidepressant medication has been selected, it can be \\nstarted initially at lower doses and careful monitoring to \\nTable 8: Psychotherapeutic interventions for Depression\\nType of therapy\\nCognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) •  Identifying problems, Identifying cognitive distortions/errors, generating alternative thoughts, \\nproblem solving, mastery and pleasure rating, activity scheduling, anxiety management'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/clinical_practice_guidelines_for_the_management_of.11.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='problem solving, mastery and pleasure rating, activity scheduling, anxiety management \\nstrategies‑ relaxation exercises\\nInterpersonal Therapy (IPT) •  Focuses on losses, role disputes and transitions, social isolation, deficits in social skills, and other \\ninterpersonal factor that may impact on the development of depression\\nSupportive psychotherapy •  Allowing the patient to ventilate, providing emotional support, guidance, increasing the patient’ s \\nself‑esteem, accepting feelings at face value, enhancing hope, enhancing adaptive coping\\nBehavioral Therapy (BT) • Activity scheduling, social skills training and problem solving\\nMarital Therapy (MT) •  Marital therapy conceptualizes depression as an interpersonal context such that both members of \\nthe marital dyad are included in therapy.

The treatment algorithm to be followed is \\nshown in figure-4. Patients who have been treated with \\nantidepressants in the acute phase need to be maintained on \\nsame dose of these agents for 16-24 weeks to prevent relapse \\n(total period of 6-9 month from initiation of treatment). There \\nare evidences to support the use of specific psychotherapy \\nin continuation phase to prevent relapse. The use of other \\nsomatic modalities (e.g. ECT) may be useful in patients where \\npharmacology and/or psychotherapy have failed to maintain \\nstability in continuation phase. The frequency of visit during \\nthe continuation phase may be determined by patient’s clinical \\ncondition as well as the specific treatment being provided. If \\nmaintenance phase treatment is not indicated for patients who \\nremain s table  following the continuation phase, patients may \\nbe considered for discontinuation of treatment. If treatment \\nis discontinued, careful monitoring be done for relapse, and \\ntreatment to be promptly reinstituted if relapse occurs.\\nTREATMENT IN MAINTENENCE PHASE\\nThe goal of maintenance phase treatment is to prevent recurrence \\nof depressive episodes. On an average, 50-85% of patients with \\na single episode of major depression have at least one more \\nepisodes. Therefore, maintenance phase treatment may be \\nconsidered to prevent recurrence. The duration of treatment \\nmay be decided keeping in view the previous treatment history \\nand number of depressive episodes the person has had in the \\npast. Mostly the treatment that was effective for acute and \\ncontinuation phase need to be used in the maintenance phase \\n(Figure-5). Same doses of antidepressants, to which the patient \\nhad responded in previous phase is considered. The frequency \\nof visit for CBT and IPTcan be reduced during the maintenance \\nphase (once a month). There is no consensus regarding the \\nduration and when to give and when not to give maintenance \\ntreatment. There is agreement to large extent that patients \\nwho have history of three or more relapses or recurrences need \\nto be given long-term treatment. \\nDISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT\\nThe decision to discontinue maintenance treatment may \\nbe based on the same factors considered in the decision to \\ninitiate maintenance treatment, including the probability \\nof recurrence, the frequency and severity of past episodes, \\nthe persistence of depressive symptoms after recovery, the \\npresence of comorbid disorders, and patient preferences. \\nWhen the decision is made to discontinue or terminate \\npsychotherapy in the maintenance phase, the manner in \\nwhich this is done may be individualized to the patient’s \\nneeds. When the decision is made to discontinue maintenance \\npharmacotherapy, it is best to taper the medication over \\nthe course of at least several weeks to few months. Such \\ntapering may allow for the detection of emerging symptoms \\nor recurrences when patients are still partially treated and \\ntherefore can be easily returned to full therapeutic intensity. \\nIn addition, such tapering can help minimize the risks of an anticonvulsant etc.  Adding, changing, or increasing the \\nintensity of psychotherapy may be considered for patients \\nwho do not respond to medication treatment. Following any \\nchange in treatment, close monitoring need to be done. If at \\nleast a moderate level of improvement in depressive symptoms \\nis not seen after an additional 4–8 weeks of treatment, another \\nthorough review need to be done. This reappraisal may include \\nverifying the patient’s diagnosis and adherence; identifying and \\naddressing clinical factors that may be preventing improvement, \\nsuch as the presence of comorbid general medical conditions \\nor psychiatric conditions (e.g., alcohol or substance abuse); \\nand identifying and addressing psychosocial issues that may \\nbe impeding recovery.

If no new information is uncovered to \\nexplain the patient’s lack of adequate response, depending on \\nthe severity of depression, ECT maybe considered. \\nChoice of a specific psychotherapy:  Out of the various \\npsychotherapeutic interventions used for management \\nof depression, there is robust level of evidence for use of \\nCBT. The major determinants of type of psychotherapy \\nare patient preference and the availability of clinicians \\nwith appropriate training and expertise in specific \\npsychotherapeutic approaches. Other clinical factors which \\nwill influence the type of psychotherapy include the severity \\nof the depression. Psychotherapy is usually recommended \\nfor patients with depression who are experiencing stressful \\nlife events, interpersonal conflicts, family conflicts, poor \\nsocial support and comorbid personality issues.\\nThe optimal frequency of psychotherapy may be based on \\nspecific type and goals of the psychotherapy, the frequency \\nnecessary to create and maintain a therapeutic relationship, \\nthe frequency of visits required to ensure treatment \\nadherence, and the frequency necessary to monitor and \\naddress suicidality. Other factors which would also determine \\nthe frequency of psychotherapy visits include the severity \\nof illness, the patient’s cooperation with treatment, the \\navailability of social supports, cost, geographic accessibility, \\nand presence of comorbid general medical problems. \\nBesides the use of specific psychotherapy, all patients and their \\ncaregivers may receive psychoeducation about the illness. \\nRole of Yoga and Meditation in management of \\ndepression: Studies related to role of traditional therapies \\nlike meditation, Yoga and other techniques have been \\nmostly published in documents of various organizations \\npropagating that particular technique. Well-designed \\nscientific studies to authenticate these claims need to \\nbe conducted; however, efficacy of these techniques as \\nsupportive/adjuctive therapy is widely accepted.\\nTREATMENT IN CONTINUATION PHASE\\nThe goal of continuation phase is to maintain the gains \\nachieved in the acute phase of treatment and prevent relapse \\nDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/indianjpsychiatry by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4\\nXMi0hCywCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC4/OAVpDDa8KKGKV0Ymy+78= on 09/18/2024'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/clinical_practice_guidelines_for_the_management_of.11.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='Gautam, et al.: CPGs for depressionIndian J Psychiatry 59 (Supplement 1), January 2017 S45Table 11: Management of depression Special situations\\nSpecial situation Strategies\\nSuicidal risk • Risk of suicide is high in patients with depression.\\n• Suicide risk to be assessed initially and over the course of treatment.\\n• If the patient has suicidal ideation, intention, and/or a plan, close surveillance is necessary .\\n•  Whenever possible, information about presence of suicidal ideation in patient be shared with family members and \\nthey need to be instructed for various safety measures to be taken.\\n•  The risk of suicide in some patients recovering from depression increases transiently as they develop the ener gy \\nand capacity to act on self‑destructive plans made earlier in the course of their illness.

Other \\nantidepressant like SSRIs, TCAs, etc., may be used for patient with asthma without any apprehension about drug \\ninteraction.\\nGlaucoma •  Antidepressants that cause or exacerbate acute close angle glaucoma include medications with anticholinergics, \\nserotonergic or adrenergic properties.\\n•  TCAs have the greatest anticholinergic properties,\\n•  SSRIs and SNRIs by virtue of their action on serotonin receptor can also cause mydriasis and thereby can produce \\npapillary block.\\n• Antidepressants lacking anticholinergic and serotonergic activity (bupropion) may be preferred.\\n• Benzodiazepines (Diazepam) have mild anticholinergics properties. \\nObstructive uropathy •  Prostatism and other forms of bladder outlet obstruction are relative contraindications to the use of antidepressant \\nmedication compounds with antimuscarinic effects.\\n• Benzodiazepines, trazodone, and MAOIs may also retard bladder emptying.\\n• The antidepressant medications with the least propensity to do this are SSRIs, bupropion, and desipramine.\\nParkinson’s disease •  Bupropion, exerts a beneficial effect on the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease in some patients but may also induce \\npsychotic symptoms, perhaps because of its agonistic action in the dopaminer gic system.\\n•  MAOIs (other than selegiline, also known as L‑deprenyl, a selective type B MAOI is recommended in the treatment \\nof Parkinson’s disease) may adversely interact with L‑dopa products.\\n•  Selegiline loses its specificity for MAO‑B in doses greater than 10 mg/day and may induce serotonin syndrome \\nwhen given in higher doses in conjunction with serotonin‑enhancing antidepressant medications.\\n•  There is no evidence favoring any particular antidepressant medication from the standpoint of therapeutic efficacy \\nin patients with Parkinson’s disease complicated by depressive disorder.\\n•  The theoretical benefits of the antimuscarinic effects of some of the TCAs in the treatment of patients with depressive \\ndisorder with Parkinson’s disease are offset by the memory impairment that may result.\\n• ECT exerts a transient beneficial effect on the symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease in many patients.\\n•  Amoxapine, an antidepressant medication with dopamine‑receptor blocking properties, may be avoided for patients \\nwho have Parkinson’s disease.\\n• Lithium may in some instances induce or exacerbate parkinsonian symptoms. \\nMalignancy •  In treatment of depression in subjects with malignancy, SSRI are considered to be the first line drugs. The advantage \\nof SSRI is that they can act as effective adjunct analgesic drugs, especially in neuropathic pain. Disadvantages \\nof SSRI are drug‑drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by CYP450/3A4 (e.g. cyclophosphamide, \\ndoxorubicin).

Fluoxetine, may be used with caution especially is patients with hepatic insufficiency, since it has \\na long half‑life.\\n•  TCAs are also good adjunct analgesics. But the disadvantages with TCAs are anticholinergic side effects and \\northostatic hypotension. They can also worsen their side effects of drugs like opioids (e.g. constipation and dry \\nmouth) which are often needed for pain control.\\n•  Psychostimulants, with their rapid onset of action have some advantages for depressed cancer patients in the sense \\nof promoting a sense of well‑being, decreasing fatigue, stimulating appetite, potentiating the analgesic effect of \\nopioids and decreasing opioid induced sedation.\\n•  The goal of psychological treatment in depressed patients with cancer is to reduce emotional distress, improve \\nmorale, coping ability, self‑esteem and sense of control. \\nDrug induced depression •  If medication induced depression is suspected, the suspected drug should be discontinued if possible and replaced \\nwith another agent less likely to induce depression.\\n•  When this is not possible or when discontinuation does not result in remission of the depressive symptoms, \\npharmacotherapy for the depression may be considered. \\nContd...\\nDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/indianjpsychiatry by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4\\nXMi0hCywCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC4/OAVpDDa8KKGKV0Ymy+78= on 09/18/2024'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/clinical_practice_guidelines_for_the_management_of.11.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='Gautam, et al.: CPGs for depressionIndian J Psychiatry 59 (Supplement 1), January 2017 S48Table 11: Contd...\\nSpecial situation Strategies\\nLiver disease •  Liver impairment affects basic elements of medication pharmacokinetics, from absorption to metabolism, \\ndistribution to elimination, changing drug levels, duration of action, and efficacy .\\n• Most antidepressants are highly protein‑bound‑ except, venlafaxine, and methylphenidate.\\n•  In liver failure, a reduction in albumin and alpha1‑acid‑glycoprotein production, along with altered protein‑binding, \\nleads to higher levels of free pharmacologically‑active drug. This is offset by a compensatory increase in the rate of \\nhepatic metabolism, and this is especially important for drugs with low intrinsic clearance.\\n•  Most antidepressants are highly lipid‑soluble and require hepatic metabolism (biotransformation into more polar \\ncompounds) to allow them to be cleared from the body in urine or bile.\\n•  Antidepressants can also be divided into two major categories of clearance, determined by their enzyme affinity. \\nFlow‑limited drugs have high hepatic extraction, and their hepatic clearance is dependent on the rate of delivery of \\nthe drug to the liver. TCAs undergo significant first pass metabolism of greater than 50% after oral administration.\\n•  Drugs with low hepatic‑enzyme affinity (e.g., paroxetine) are metabolized more slowly, as enzyme saturation is the \\nrate limiting step. The severity of impairment rather than the underlying aetiology is the most important factor to \\nconsider in prescribing for this group. Renal function may also be af fected.\\n•  As the risk of drug toxicity increases with disease severity, lower starting and total doses of medication are \\nrecommended (starting dose ‑about one forth that of adults). \\nRenal disease • In this group of patients, TCAs are probably safer than SSRIs.\\n• The degree of renal impairment rather than the cause is most important.\\n•  Renal impairment may be present without a raised creatinine level. TCAs metabolites are excreted by the kidneys, \\nhence accumulation may occur. Of the SSRIs, sertraline is not recommended by its manufacturers in renal failure.\\n•  Fluoxetine, citalopram and paroxetine may be started at very low dose in patients with a glomerular filtration rate \\nof at least>10 ml/min.\\n•  Lithium may only be prescribed if absolutely necessary, at low doses, on alternate days, with frequent checking of \\nserum levels.\\nPerioperative period •  TCAs may preferably be stopped prior to surgery. SSRIs and MAOI can interact with pethidine, pentazocine, and \\ndextromethorphan, at the pharmacodynamics levels and lead to serotonin syndrome, therefore such drugs may be \\navoided during the perioperative period. However, SSRIs may not be discontinued in order to prevent anesthetic \\ninteractions, except when the SSRI is used in combination with aspirin or an Non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory \\ndrugs and when the SSRI is used in patients over 80 years of age. In these patients, the balance of risks of \\nwithdrawal and bleeding is to be discussed with patients. Because abrupt discontinuation can cause serious \\nwithdrawal symptoms, the drugs may be gradually discontinued over few days to 2 weeks before surgery.\\n•  Lithium can contribute to hemodynamic instabilities, interfere with sodium and potassium metabolism, and the \\nrenal excretion of lithium can be reduced in presence of renal complications. The physical risk of intoxication, \\nwith its detrimental and fatal risks for the central nervous system, is unacceptable. Therefore, lithium \\ndiscontinuation is recommended. Lithium can be stopped at once because no withdrawal symptoms occur.\\n•  When, postoperatively, the patient is hemodynamically stable, is able and allowed to drink, and is not on new, \\npotentially interfering drugs, the medication may be restarted gradually.\\nantidepressant medication discontinuation syndromes. \\nDiscontinuation syndromes have been found to be more'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/clinical_practice_guidelines_for_the_management_of.11.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='potentially interfering drugs, the medication may be restarted gradually.\\nantidepressant medication discontinuation syndromes. \\nDiscontinuation syndromes have been found to be more \\nfrequent after discontinuation of medications with shorter \\nhalf-lives, and patients maintained on short-acting agents \\nmay be given even longer, more gradual tapering.

First step in care of a patient who has not responded to medication is carrying out \\na thorough review and reappraisal of the psychosocial \\nand biological information base, aimed at revarifying the \\ndiagnosis and identifying any neglected and possibly \\ncontributing factors, including the general medical \\nproblems, alcohol or substance abuse or dependence, \\nother psychiatric disorders, and general psychosocial issues \\nimpeding recovery.

It addresses three developmental cohorts: \\nchildren and adolescents; general adults; and older adults (ages 60 and \\nover). Ten systematic reviews and meta-analyses, along with other litera -\\nture and observations from practitioners and patients, served as the basis \\nfor the guideline. The guideline development panel consisted of health \\nprofessionals from psychology, psychiatry, and primary care as well as \\ncommunity members who self-identified as having had depression. The \\npanel examined the efficacy of psychological treatments and of comple -\\nmentary and alternative medicine treatments.  It also examined compara -\\ntive effectiveness among psychological treatments (by themselves and in \\ncombination with pharmacotherapy) and comparative effectiveness of \\npsychological treatments in relation to pharmacotherapy and to comple -\\nmentary and alternative treatments. The panel made no treatment recom-mendations specific to children but did make recommendations for \\ntreatment of depression in adolescents, adults, and older adults. These \\nrecommendations are detailed in the guideline.\\nKeywords: Depression; clinical practice guideline; best practices\\nINTENDED USE OF GUIDELINE\\nThis guideline is intended to be aspirational and is not intended to create a \\nrequirement for practice. It is not intended to limit scope of practice in \\nlicensing laws for psychologists or for other independently licensed profes -\\nsionals, nor limit coverage for reimbursement by third party payers. Nor is \\nthe guideline intended to be used within a legal or judicial context to imply that psychologists or other independently licensed professionals are \\nrequired to comply with any of its recommendations. \\nThe term guideline  refers to statements that suggest or recommend \\nspecific professional behavior, endeavor, or conduct for psychologists \\nand may be useful for other clinicians. Guidelines differ from standards \\nin that standards are mandatory and may be accompanied by an enforce -\\nment mechanism. Thus, guidelines are aspirational in intent. They are \\nintended to facilitate the continued systematic development of the pro -\\nfession and to help assure a high level of professional practice by psy -\\nchologists. Guidelines are not intended to be mandatory or exhaustive \\nand may not be applicable to every professional and clinical situation. \\nThey are not definitive, and they are not intended to take precedence \\nover the judgment of psychologists. Please refer to the APA’s (2015a) \\nProfessional Practice Guidelines: Guidance for Developers and Users for a \\ndiscussion of the several types of guidelines produced by APA. Clinical \\npractice guidelines are an important tool for determining intervention \\noptions but are not the only resource.\\nClinicians are encouraged to consider the report from the APA \\nPresidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice (APA, 2006), \\nEvidence-Based Practice in Psychology , which emphasizes the integration \\nof best available research; patient characteristics, culture, and preferenc -\\nes; and clinical expertise for making treatment decisions. \\nIn reviewing the recommendation statements, the panel reminds \\nthe reader that a lack of evidence about a treatment does not imply that that treatment is not efficacious. Rather, there are several gaps in the literature about treatments as well as limitations in the specific literature \\nreviewed by the panel due to methodological constraints, as discussed \\nlater in the guideline document. Clinicians are encouraged to provide \\ninformed consent to patients.  \\nINDIVIDUALIZING TREATMENT\\nClinicians strive to individualize treatments. So how might one follow'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='informed consent to patients.  \\nINDIVIDUALIZING TREATMENT\\nClinicians strive to individualize treatments. So how might one follow \\nevidence-based clinical practice guidelines, yet honor the individuality of patients? A comprehensive assessment can help identify factors that \\nmight require modifications to a treatment recommended by clinical practice guidelines. These include patient factors such as race; ethnicity; \\nsocioeconomic status; culture and/or heritage; or other features of their \\nidentities, values, or preferences.  In addition, the patient’s comorbidities, \\nsocial support, and ability to obtain childcare when needed, as well as the \\nclinician’s accessibility, location, hours of operation, available appoint -\\nments, proximity to public transportation, and other resources that can \\naffect treatment, must be considered. Further, provider and setting fac -\\ntors like constraints tied to duration of treatment, provider availability, or \\nother factors will impact the application of a treatment recommended by \\na clinical practice guideline. Combining an individual assessment with the \\nresearch summarized in the clinical practice guideline can help develop \\na conceptualization of the change processes that underpin the effective \\ntreatment to guide individualization decisions. This can promote “flex -\\nibility within fidelity” (Kendall, Gosch, Furr, & Sood, 2008) to facilitate \\nthe use of research-supported change processes to achieve the patient’s \\ngoals while individualizing the specific strategies. Especially when a rec -\\nommended treatment is modified, providing full informed consent about \\npossible treatments is necessary.

It addresses three developmental cohorts: \\nchildren and adolescents, general adults, and older adults (ages 60 and over2). Ten systematic \\nreviews and meta-analyses (Cipriani et al., 2016; Cuijpers, Driessen, et al., 2012a; Cuijpers, \\nKaryotaki, Pot, Park, & Reynolds, 2014a; Cuijpers, Koole, van Dijke, Roca, & Reynolds, 2014b; \\nCuijpers, Donker, Weissman, Ravitz, & Cristea, 2016; Driessen et al., 2015; ECRI Institute, \\n2015; Gartlehner et al., 2015; Wilkinson & Izmeth, 2012; Zhou et al., 2015) served as the basis \\nfor this guideline. This guideline addresses the efficacy of psychological and complementary \\nand alternative medicine treatments, the comparative effectiveness of psychotherapy in \\ncombination with pharmacotherapy as well as compared to pharmacotherapy and comple -\\nmentary and alternative treatments.3 For child and adolescent populations only, the guideline \\nalso examines the efficacy of medications, but because other existing guidelines adequately \\naddress this for adults, the panel chose not to review this body of evidence. The guideline then addresses harms and burdens of treatment and patient\\n4 values and preferences. The reviews \\non which this guideline is based did not specifically address screening for depression, assess -\\nment of associated comorbid conditions (e.g., suicidality, medical problems), monitoring response to treatment, locus of care, prevention of depression, dose, timing or duration of \\ntreatments for depression, costs of treatment, long-term benefits of treatment, mechanisms \\nof change, bipolar disorder, or efficacy of treatments for disorders other than depression. \\n1 Not e that psychotic depression is not covered by this guideline. The panel recognizes this as an important sub -\\nset of depression. However, the scope of the guideline is currently extensive, and the incorporation of psy -\\nchotic depression would have required additional reviews focusing on antipsychotic medications.\\n2 Although the panel defined older adults as ag es 60 and over, at least one study included in the older adult \\nreviews included individuals as young as 50. This resulted in some overlap between the general adult and older \\nadult populations that the panel was not able to separate out due to the way the data was analyzed. However, \\na majority of studies defined older adults as ages 60 and up and individual studies that defined older adults as \\n50 and up will be noted. This overlap may be considered by clinicians when making recommendations for indi-\\nvidual patients that fall within this age range.\\n3 T he panel initially intended to include somatic treatments, but due to limitations in the available reviews the \\ncurrent guideline does not address these areas.\\n4 T o be consistent with discussions of evidence-based practice in other areas of health care, we use the term \\npatient to refer to the child, adolescent, adult, older adult, couple, family, group, organization, community, or \\nother populations receiving psychological services. However, we recognize that in many situations there are \\nimportant and valid reasons for using such terms as client, consumer or person in place of patient to describe \\nthe recipients of services.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='4\\u2003APA \\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of DepressionThese topics are important to patient care and discussed as appro -\\npriate, but the guideline does not contain specific recommendations \\nin these domains. The Process and Methods section details the \\npanel’s decision-making throughout guideline development.  It is \\nimportant to note that the phrase “insufficient evidence” indicates \\nthat there were not enough data to provide for definitive recommen-\\ndations. However, this lack of data can be due to the situation where \\n(a) no relevant studies existed within the time frame of this review, \\n(b) a very small number of relevant studies existed, or (c) multiple \\nrelevant studies existed but only provided equivocal findings. In addi -\\ntion, the lack of relevant studies can exist even if multiple studies did \\ncompare certain interventions but did not provide robust findings, as \\nwell as no studies were conducted that included comparisons \\nbetween various interventions.\\nBackground \\nMajor depression is the second leading cause of disability as of 2013 \\nboth worldwide (Vos et al., 2015) as well as in the United States (U.S. \\nBurden of Disease Collaborators, 2013). Major depressive disorder is \\ncharacterized by a depressed mood (or irritability in children) or loss of pleasure or interest for at least 2 weeks (American Psychiatric \\nAssociation, 2013). It is also accompanied by at least three (for a total \\nof at least five) of the following symptoms present most days: weight \\nloss or change in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor \\nretardation or agitation, fatigue or loss of energy, excessive/inappro -\\npriate guilt or feelings of worthlessness, indecisiveness or diminished \\nability to concentrate or think, and recurrent thoughts of death or \\nsuicidal ideation or suicide plan or attempt (American Psychiatric \\nAssociation, 2013). Another depressive disorder, persistent depres-\\nsive disorder (formerly called dysthymia) in the Diagnostic and \\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders  (5th ed.; DSM-5; American \\nPsychiatric Association, 2013), is characterized by a depressed mood \\nmost of the time for at least 2 years, along with at least two of the \\nfollowing symptoms: feeling hopeless, insomnia or hypersomnia, \\novereating or poor appetite, fatigue or low energy, low self-esteem, \\nand indecisiveness or poor concentration (American Psychiatric \\nAssociation, 2013). In children and adolescents, the mood can be \\nirritable, and the duration of persistent depressive disorder is at least \\n1 year.  Moreover, there cannot be a gap in these symptoms for more \\nthan 2 months, a hypomanic or manic episode during this time period, \\nnor criteria met for cyclothymic disorder, and symptoms are not \\nbetter explained by another disorder, cause significant impairment in \\nfunctioning or distress, and are not due to a different medical condi -\\ntion or a substance use disorder (American Psychiatric Association, \\n2013). For patients that do not meet full criteria for the aforemen-\\ntioned depressive disorders (depressive episode with insufficient \\nsymptoms) but either experience recurrent episodes of depressed \\nmood and at least four other symptoms of depression for 2–13 days \\n5 Ho wever, the systematic reviews and studies that are discussed in this guideline use the broader definitions “subclinical” or “subsyndromal” depression (i.e., Cuijpers, \\nKoole, van Dijke et al., 2014). \\n6 Of not e, as of March 2016, the division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies) formerly known as Institute of \\nMedicine (IOM) was renamed the National Academy of Medicine (NAM). Despite the recent name change, the guideline will use IOM when referring to the IOM stan-\\ndards for guideline development and systematic reviews.(recurrent brief depression) or experience a depressive episode for \\n4–13 days (short-duration depressive episode), the DSM-5 presents \\nthis as Other Specified Depressive Disorder (American Psychiatric'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='4–13 days (short-duration depressive episode), the DSM-5 presents \\nthis as Other Specified Depressive Disorder (American Psychiatric \\nAssociation, 2013).5  \\nThe current guideline is designed to complement the existing \\nknowledge base in several ways. It covers a broad range of the pop -\\nulation (children through older adults) and includes psychothera -\\npeutic interventions. Earlier guidelines have either been completed \\n5 or more years prior, provided limited guidance on psychothera -\\npies, or focused on recommendations for a specific population. The \\ncurrent guideline follows the Institute of Medicine (IOM, 2011a; \\nIOM, 2011b)6 standards to the extent possible for rigorous guide -\\nline development. This guideline is also intended for a broad inter -\\nnational audience, not only for individuals in the United States.\\nProcess and Method\\nUndertaking the creation of a guideline requires several key decisions. \\nAPA’s Advisory Steering Committee issued a call for nominations \\n(including self-nominations) for individuals to serve as panel members \\nfrom a variety of backgrounds (patient, psychology, psychiatry, general \\nmedicine) with content knowledge or methodological expertise. \\nConflicts of interest (financial and nonfinancial) were considered and \\nmanaged both during panel member selection and throughout the \\nguideline development process. Research Triangle International–\\nUniversity of North Carolina (RTI-UNC) Evidence-Based Practice \\nCenter and American Psychological Association (APA) staff used the \\nPopulation, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, Timing, and \\nSettings (PICOTS) framework (a systematic approach to conducting a \\ncomprehensive literature review of a clinical subject matter) to guide \\nthe panel during its initial question-formulation stage.\\nIn selecting which outcomes were most critical for deciding on \\nthe level or strength of a recommendation, the panel decided that \\nresponse to treatment (reduction in depressive symptoms) and seri -\\nous associated harms/adverse events were critical. The panel fur -\\nther decided that the following additional outcomes were important: \\nremission (no longer having symptoms), quality of life, functional \\ncapacity, patient satisfaction, relapse, recurrence, and suicidality.\\nThe guideline was developed in a series of phases, based on \\nthe three developmental cohorts.  Briefly, with the support of the \\nRTI-UNC Evidence-Based Practice Center scientists, the older adult \\nliterature was reviewed based on the results of an umbrella review \\nthey conducted to determine existing systematic reviews in the lit -\\nerature. RTI-UNC Evidence-Based Practice Center scientists devel -\\noped evidence profiles for the panel compiling data from reviews \\nby Wilkinson and Izmeth (2012) and Cuijpers, Karyotaki, Pot, et al. \\n(2014a). For the general adult section, the panel used data from an \\nexisting systematic review by RTI-UNC Evidence-Based Practice \\nCenter scientists (Gartlehner et al., 2015). The panel supplemented'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='APA\\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depression\\u2003 5this to fill in gaps of information with data from several others \\nreviews that met quality criteria based on either an AMSTAR (A \\nMeasurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews; an instrument \\nused to evaluate systematic reviews and meta-analyses for quality; \\nShea et al., 2007) review (Cuijpers, Driessen, et al., 2012a; Cuijpers, \\nKoole, et al., 2014b; Cuijpers et al., 2016; Driessen et al., 2015) or \\nhaving followed IOM systematic review standards (ECRI Institute, \\n2015). Specifically, this AMSTAR instrument consists of a checklist \\nassessing 11 items and was used by scientists who were not panel \\nmembers to evaluate systematic reviews for quality. For the child \\nand adolescent literature, the panel used two systematic reviews/\\nmeta-analyses that met quality criteria based on an AMSTAR \\nreview: Cipriani et al. (2016) and Zhou et al. (2015). Based on the results of the umbrella review as well as follow-up AMSTAR quali -\\nty reviews, it was determined that existing systematic reviews and \\nmeta-analyses were of sufficient breadth and quality such that it \\nwas not necessary to commission a de novo review. The panel uti -\\nlized systematic reviews/meta-analyses that were current within \\nthe past 5 years at the time the panel made its recommendation \\ndecisions that met IOM (2011b) development and AMSTAR quality \\nstandards. While this is consistent with rigorous guideline develop -\\nment, the panel noted this approach can be limiting in that studies \\nexploring the efficacy of psychotherapy are not conducted equally \\nacross modalities and are not regularly updated every 5 years due, \\nin part, to psychotherapy research receiving support from govern -\\nment funds (rather than private companies). Altogether, system -\\natic reviews and meta-analyses conducted more than 5 years ago \\nwere not explicitly examined by the panel.\\n \\nThe panel considered four factors as it drafted recommenda -\\ntions based on IOM standards: (1) overall strength of the evidence, \\n(2) balance of benefits versus harms/burdens, (3) patient values \\nand preferences, and (4) applicability. Based on the combination \\nof these factors, the panel made a recommendation or condition -\\nal recommendation for or against each particular treatment or \\nmade a statement that there was insufficient evidence to be able \\nto make a recommendation for or against. The panel used a tool \\ncalled a decision table (created by APA staff) to document its deci -\\nsion-making process for each recommendation for older adults. \\nCopies of the decision tables are available in Appendix C of the \\nsupplemental materials. The panel later streamlined the decision \\ntable to a “grid” to document decision-making, which can also be \\nfound in the supplemental materials ( linked separately ).\\nDiscussion\\nThroughout the panel’s discussions, it was emphasized that patient \\nvalues and preferences should be taken into consideration through \\nshared decision-making with the clinician. Clinicians using this \\nguideline are encouraged to consider challenges faced by patients \\nsuch as barriers to treatment (i.e., structural and perceptual). \\nWhile the panel followed a rigorous methodological process \\nfor guideline development, the panel identified challenges and \\nlimitations to consider for future efforts. The panel tried to be \\nas broad as possible and used the PICOTS outline, but the scope \\ncould not be all-encompassing and thus excluded many important populations (i.e., reviews focused exclusively on individuals with \\ncomorbid medical disorders), and settings (i.e., inpatient, collab -\\norative care) were not included in the reviews. Another challenge \\nwas balancing adherence to the IOM (2011a) standards for rigor -\\nous guideline development while also including adequate coverage of the research literature. We discuss these limitations in full on'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='was balancing adherence to the IOM (2011a) standards for rigor -\\nous guideline development while also including adequate coverage of the research literature. We discuss these limitations in full on \\np. 53 of the guideline.  Further, the panel noted a wide range of research concerns, including that many of the studies included in \\nreviews were of low quality. In particular, the panel noted the need \\nto expand the research literature to specifically include underrep -\\nresented and underserved populations, including people of diverse \\nracial/ethnic and cultural heritage backgrounds, gender and sex -\\nual minority populations, and socioeconomically diverse groups. \\nIn addition to the multifocal call for inclusivity in research design \\nand funding to better address the needs of diverse populations, \\nincluding those that experience lower SES, we encourage clini -\\ncians to refer to APA’s (2017b) Multicultural Guidelines: An Ecological \\nApproach to Context, Identity, and Intersectionality  to assist in imple -\\nmentation of recommendations. The labeling of psychotherapies \\nis a challenge as well, given the large variability in how a system -\\natic review team clusters particular forms of psychotherapies (i.e., \\n“cognitive-behavioral approaches” includes a number of specific \\ntreatments such as problem-solving therapy and dialectical behav -\\nior therapy; see Table 2 in Appendix G for details).\\nAdditional limitations the panel noted across cohorts include \\nthat much research is highly dependent on federal research funding, \\nparticularly psychotherapy research. Also, there are differences in \\nthe amount of research evidence available for different therapeutic \\napproaches (e.g., there is more evidence available for cognitive-be -\\nhavioral therapy than for psychodynamic therapy and hardly any \\nfor humanistic therapies). Each of these factors limits the broad \\napplicability of research findings. Further, while much research \\nfocused on symptomatic change, more research is needed on \\nadditional important outcomes such as patient-centered outcomes \\n(i.e., quality of life and interpersonal relationships, social engage -\\nment, occupational functioning). Research is also needed on the \\nmoderators of treatment and outcomes, matching of patients with \\ntreatments, and innovative approaches to dissemination (e.g., col -\\nlaborative care and integrated care). Finally, the panel agreed that \\nthe body of the depression treatment research literature needs far \\nmore attention on patient populations that have comorbid condi -\\ntions; long-term outcomes of psychotherapy; treatment for racial -\\nly, ethnically, or socioeconomically diverse populations as well as \\nmarginalized communities and gender diverse populations; as well \\nas a personalized medicine approach to treatment. \\nRecommendations\\nIn reviewing the recommendations from the panel, it is important for \\nthe reader to be familiar with the definition of several terms as follows:\\nTreatment as usual. Refers to the care that is customarily provided \\nin a particular situation. The panel notes the challenge of a consistent \\ndefinition of treatment as usual, given that the exact definition can \\nvary by study.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='6\\u2003APA \\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of DepressionNo treatment.

Depressive disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder, persistent \\ndepressive disorder) are some of the most prevalent, impairing, and costly disorders of any \\nkind. The Global Burden of Disease Study reported that major depression was the third lead -\\ning cause of worldwide disability in 1990 and had risen to the second leading cause by 2013 \\nboth worldwide (Vos et al., 2015) and in the United States (U.S. Burden of Disease Collaborators, \\n2013). Major depression leads to lost work productivity and increased morbidity and mortal -\\nity due to direct effects associated with increased risk of suicide, reduced functional behaviors, \\nand interpersonal functioning. It also leads to added consequences due to indirect effects on \\nhealth through the exacerbation of other major causes of morbidity and mortality (Cuijpers, \\nVogelzangs, Twisk, Kleiboer, & Penninx, 2014c; Elderon & Whooley, 2013; Katon, 2003; Liu et \\nal., 2017) and increasing prevalence of diabetes—especially among youth and middle-aged \\nadults in the United States and worldwide (Lin et al., 2009).\\nMajor depressive disorder is characterized by a depressed mood (or irritability in \\nchildren) and/or loss of pleasure or interest for at least 2 weeks (American Psychiatric \\nAssociation, 2013). It is accompanied by at least three (for a total of at least five) of the \\nfollowing symptoms present most days: weight loss and/or change in appetite, insomnia \\nor hypersomnia, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue or loss of energy, excessive/\\ninappropriate guilt or feelings of worthlessness, indecisiveness or diminished ability to \\nconcentrate or think, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or suicide plan \\nor attempt (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Another depressive disorder, per -\\nsistent depressive disorder, is characterized by a depressed mood most of the time for at \\nleast 2 years, along with at least two of the following symptoms: feeling hopeless, insom -\\nnia or hypersomnia, overeating or poor appetite, fatigue or low energy, low self-esteem, \\nand indecisiveness or poor concentration (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). In \\nchildren and adolescents, the duration is at least one year, and the mood can be irritable. \\nMoreover, there cannot be a gap in these symptoms for more than 2 months, a hypomanic \\nor manic episode during this time period, nor criteria met for cyclothymic disorder. Further, \\nsymptoms are not better explained by another disorder, cause significant impairment in \\nfunctioning or distress, and are not due to a different medical condition or a substance \\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2013). \\nThe level of population disability associated with depressive disorders (major depres -\\nsive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, subsyndromal depression, and other mani -\\nfestations) is a function of the severity and chronic or recurrent nature of the symptoms, \\nand the high frequency of the disorder. Unlike other chronic illnesses, first onset of major \\ndepressive disorder often occurs in late teens or early adulthood. In the United States, \\napproximately 6.7% to 7.6% of adults report an episode of major depression in a 12-month \\nperiod, with women having approximately 1.7 times the risk as men (Substance Abuse and \\nMental Health Service Administration, 2015; Kessler, McGonagle, Swartz, Blazer, & Nelson, \\n1993). In marginalized populations and those of lower SES, rates are likely to be significantly \\nhigher (Weinberger et al., 2017). Lifetime prevalence is estimated at 17.9%. Major depres -\\nsion is frequently comorbid with other mental health disorders, particularly anxiety disor -\\nders and substance use disorders.

Depression is one of \\nthe most common psychiatric disorders in adolescents (Costello, \\nErkanli, & Angold, 2006). There are reports of a 11.7% lifetime prev -\\nalence rate for major depressive disorder or dysthymic disorder in \\nadolescents based on data from the National Comorbidity Study—\\nAdolescent Supplement (Merikangas et al., 2010). Moreover, there \\nwas a 2.6% increase between 2005 to 2014 in adolescents experi-\\nencing a major depressive episode (Mojtabai, Olfson, & Han, 2016). \\nRates among same-aged youth of low SES, or who are members of \\nmarginalized populations, are believed to be significantly higher \\n(Hasin, Goodwin, Stinson, & Grant, 2005). Adolescence is a unique \\nperiod given the dramatic increase in risk for depression during this \\nperiod. The impairments associated with adolescent depression also \\nhave been found to persist into adulthood and reflect the significant \\nmorbidity and lifelong impairment associated with the disorder \\n(Glied & Pine, 2002; Lewinsohn et al., 1994; Lewinsohn, Rohde, Klein, \\n& Seeley, 1999). The National Comorbidity Study—Adolescent \\nSupplement found that rates of depression markedly increased \\namong youth ages 13 through 18 years (Avenevoli, Swendsen, He, \\nBurstein, & Merikangas. 2015) and that prevalence of major depres -\\nsive disorder (MDD) is two times higher in older than younger ado -\\nlescents as well as higher in female than male adolescents (Avenevoli \\net al., 2015). Furthermore, adolescents with anxiety disorders, atten-\\ntion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, substance use disorders, and \\nbehavior disorders (i.e., oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disor -\\nder) have significant rates of comorbid MDD and higher risks of developing MDD, particularly severe MDD (Avenevoli et al., 2015). \\nIn contrast, prevalence rates for depression are lower in chil -\\ndren and preadolescents ranging from 0.4% to 2.5% of preadoles -\\ncent children (Birmaher & Rozel, 2003). These rates are for those children meeting full diagnostic criteria for major depressive dis -\\norder. Therefore, rates likely underestimate the impact of depres -\\nsion on youth, as preadolescent children who present with clini -\\ncally significant symptoms and impaired functioning, but not full clinical diagnosis are not always considered. These data may also \\nnot include significant representation of children of color or other minorities less likely to receive evaluation and treatment. These \\nchildren with subsyndromal depression are at risk for developing \\ndepression diagnoses later in childhood and adolescence. Early \\nlongitudinal studies of children with depression suggested that \\nearly onset depression in children was associated with a more pro -\\ntracted course of illness and was a marker for more severe psychi -\\natric outcomes in adolescence and adulthood (Kovacs et al., 1984; \\nKovacs, Feinberg, Crouse-Novak, Paulauskas, & Finkelstein, 1984). \\nSpecifically, it was also associated with adult depression based in \\npart on family psychiatric history (Wickramaratne, Greenwald, \\n& Weissman, 2000). The Oregon Adolescent Depression Study \\nfindings suggested that childhood depression doubled the risk of \\nexperiencing depression in adolescence, and adolescent depres -\\nsion strongly predicted depression in early adulthood (Lewinsohn, \\nRohde, Seeley, Klein, & Gotlib, 2000; Rohde, Lewinsohn, Klein, \\nSeeley, & Gau, 2013).\\nDespite the prevalence of symptoms, less than 1% of com -\\nmunity-dwelling children and adolescents in the United States receive outpatient treatment for depression each year (Avenevoli \\net al., 2015). In particular, racially and ethnically diverse youth con -\\nsistently demonstrate the greatest unmet need for mental health \\ntreatment (Alegría, Vallas, & Pumariega, 2010; Caldwell, Assari, & \\nBreland-Noble, 2016). Children and youth living in rural, remote,'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content='sistently demonstrate the greatest unmet need for mental health \\ntreatment (Alegría, Vallas, & Pumariega, 2010; Caldwell, Assari, & \\nBreland-Noble, 2016). Children and youth living in rural, remote, \\nand other underserved locations are least likely to receive needed \\nmental health treatment (Blackstock, Chae, Mauk, & McDonald, \\n2018).  Depressed children and adolescents are much less likely \\nto receive mental health treatment than adults (Olfson, Gameroff, \\nMarcus, & Waslick, 2003). Most youth who do use mental health \\nservices receive them in the school setting (Slade, 2003). Of \\nthose who reported receiving treatment for major depressive dis -\\norder in any setting (60.4%) in the National Comorbidity Study—\\nAdolescent Supplement, only 33.9% stated that they received \\ntreatment specific to their depressive disorder or in a mental \\nhealth service setting (Avenevoli et al., 2015). Accordingly, it is \\nimportant to identify effective treatment strategies for childhood \\nand adolescent depression to decrease current functional impair -\\nments and potentially disrupt the negative developmental trajecto -\\nries that can continue into adulthood.  \\nCharacteristics of depression in children and adolescents. With \\nthe introduction of the DSM-5, what were formerly known as “Mood \\nDisorders” are now referred to as “Depressive Disorders” and include Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder—Single and Recurrent Episodes, Persistent Depressive Disorder, Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, Substance/Medication-\\nInduced Depressive Disorder, Depressive Disorder Due to Another \\nMedical Condition, Other Specified Depressive Disorder, and \\nUnspecified Depressive Disorder (American Psychiatric Association, \\n2013). As indicated earlier, Major Depressive Disorder—Single and \\nRecurrent Episodes and Persistent Depressive Disorder are the dis-\\norders with the highest prevalence in adolescents. \\nDepressive disorders are generally characterized by a clus -\\nter of symptoms including sadness or low mood, crying, loss of \\ninterest in once-enjoyed activities, decreased energy, and sleep -\\ning and eating changes. While these symptoms can be present in youth and adults, in adolescence, depression may manifest in \\nslightly diverse ways. For example, over 60% of depressed teens \\nreported severe impairment in functioning related to school/work, \\nfamily, chores, and social roles (Avenevoli et al., 2015). Recent \\nresearch has shown that typical presentations of youth depressive \\nillness may include fatigue, irritability, and anger with behavioral \\ncorrelates including poor school performance, negative acting out, and poor interpersonal and peer relationships (Jaycox et al., \\n2009). Typically, individual behavior changes must occur for at \\nleast 2 weeks and must represent a notable change in functioning \\nfrom earlier levels considered normal for that individual to be con -\\nsidered impaired. Although episodes of major depressive disorder \\nare less frequent in children than adolescents, the length of the \\nepisode was significantly longer in duration in children than ado -\\nlescents (median of 16 weeks versus 8 weeks, respectively; Rohde \\net al., 2013). Regardless of the length of the episode, clinicians are encouraged to intervene as opposed to watchful waiting to allevi -\\nate suffering, particularly given the sensitive developmental peri -\\nods and tasks of childhood and adolescence.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content='APA\\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depression\\u2003 21The DSM-5  diagnostic criteria for characteristics of depres -\\nsive disorders note some exceptions for children or adolescents, \\nsuch as an exception specific to children for major depressive \\ndisorder that failure to gain expected weight rather than just sig -\\nnificant weight loss or gain should be considered during diagnosis \\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Regarding the mani -\\nfestations of major depressive disorder in youth, the American \\nAcademy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013) indicated \\nthat children and adolescents with depression exhibit symptoms \\nincluding social isolation, extreme sensitivity to rejection or failure, \\nand increased irritability. While these symptoms can also occur in \\nadults, these are symptoms that may be of great import for recog -\\nnizing depression in youth, particularly because there are import -\\nant developmental differences in verbal expression and emotional \\nmaturity between youth and adults. Overall, much of the literature \\ndoes not treat children and adolescents as separate developmen -\\ntal cohorts, thereby limiting our understanding of unique symptom \\npresentations among children and adolescents, respectively. This \\nis a concern because distinct differences in development may have \\nimplications for treatment (e.g., the appropriateness of some cog -\\nnitive strategies or forms of play therapy).\\nSex differences in children and adolescents.   Rates of depression \\ndiffer among the sexes across the age span of childhood to adoles -\\ncence. Prior to puberty, rates for depressive disorders are equivalent \\nbetween the sexes. After puberty, this shifts to a 2:1 ratio of females \\nto males, which continues throughout adulthood (Hatcher-Kay & \\nKing, 2003). The emergence of the sex difference in adolescence is \\nconsistent across samples from different countries and irrespective of the measure used to assess depressive symptomatology (Wade, \\nCairney, & Pevalin, 2002). Studies are consistent in finding that the \\nincrease in rates for females begins to emerge around the age of 13 \\n(Nolen-Hoeksema & Girgus, 1994; Thapar, Collishaw, Pine, & Thapar, \\n2012). The reasons for the post-pubertal onset of rate differences \\namong the sexes are not fully understood, but factors thought to play an influence include the hormonal and social changes that occur \\nduring puberty (Hatcher-Kay & King, 2003; Nolen-Hoeksema, 2001; \\nThapar et al., 2012).\\nChild/adolescent depression and race/ethnicity. Researchers have \\nposited many explanations for the disengagement of African \\nAmericans and other people of color in clinical treatment, mostly \\nfocusing on access to care barriers (Alegría et al., 2002; Snowden & \\nYamada, 2005).  For example, many African Americans view psychi -\\natric illness as a proscribed subject unattributable to genetic and \\ndysfunctional familial precursors, favoring instead attributes toward \\nlack of resoluteness, spirituality, and stress (Cauce et al., 2002; \\nKendrick, Anderson, & Moore, 2007; Schnittker, Freese, & Powell, \\n2000).  Further, there are barriers to care related to other people of \\ncolor focused on lack of multilingual, multicultural providers; differ -\\ning conceptualizations of mental illness; and stigma.  Other literature \\nhas suggested reasons including lack of nonracially diverse profes -\\nsionals in leadership roles, questioning of motives of nondiverse \\n33 T reatment as usual refers to the treatment that a patient would ordinarily receive.

As it relates to \\nyouth, the literature indicates that African American parents specif -\\nically are fearful of the negative consequences typically prescribed \\nfor emotionally or behaviorally disturbed children, as well as misla-\\nbeling of their children with disruptive behavior problems instead of \\ndepressive illness (McMiller & Weisz, 1996; Pastore, Juszczak, Fisher, \\n& Friedman, 1998; Wu et al., 2001).  These concerns are also relevant \\nfor other groups of people of color.\\nResearch has suggested heterogeneity in the development \\nand expression of depressive symptoms, as evidenced by diverse \\ntrajectories for different racial/ethnic groups (Costello, Swendsen, \\nRose, & Dierker, 2008). Some studies reported higher rates of \\ndepression among non-White youth than White youth (Moon & \\nRao, 2010; van Voorhees et al., 2008), while others show a greater \\npercentage of White youth with depressive symptoms than African \\nAmerican youth (Saluja et al., 2004). Additionally, data from sever -\\nal large studies suggested that, after controlling for socioeconom -\\nic status, there are no differences in the prevalence of depressive \\nsymptoms or affective disorders among Black, Hispanic/Latino, \\nAsian, and White youth (Doi, Roberts, Takeuchi, & Suzuki, 2001; \\nGarrison, Addy, Jackson, McKeown, & Waller, 1992; Rushton, \\nForcier, & Schectman, 2002). Other studies indicated that Latino \\nand Native American youth have the highest rates of depression among youth of color (Centers for Disease Control [CDC], 2012; \\nKann et al., 2014; Saluja et al., 2004). Given the profound impact \\nof SES on the developmental trajectory and the strong association \\nbetween poor mental health outcomes and the sequelae of poverty \\n(Matthew & Brodersen, 2018), further research that better depicts \\nrates and presentation of depression among marginalized popula -\\ntions is necessary.\\nWhile treatment of depression in children and adolescents \\nwith cognitive treatments is promising, little research exists about \\nthe treatment of depressive illnesses in exclusive samples of youth \\nof color. Specifically, only a small handful of studies on exclusive \\nsamples of youth of color were identified through APA staff review \\nof studies included in the underlying reviews. For example, a ran -\\ndomized controlled trial examined the use of interpersonal psy -\\nchotherapy (IPT) for the treatment of depression in Latino youth \\n(Mufson et al., 2004). In this study, IPT was found to be superi -\\nor to treatment as usual\\n33 for a sample of under resourced Latino \\nyouth regarding symptom reduction and behavioral functioning \\ncompared with youth receiving treatment as usual. Two addition -\\nal studies examined the use of both cognitive-behavioral therapy \\nand interpersonal psychotherapy for the treatment of Latino youth \\n(Rosselló & Bernal, 1999; Rosselló, Bernal, & Rivera-Medina, 2012).  \\nThese findings are promising, but considerably more research on \\nyouth of color from varied socioeconomic backgrounds is needed \\nto support these findings and to expand the knowledge base regard -\\ning the treatment of depression in racially diverse youth. Finally,'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content='22\\u2003APA \\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depressiongiven greater underutilization of clinical depression care by youth \\nof color, more research is needed to examine the impacts of engag -\\ning this population in depression treatment.  Currently, a growing \\nbody of research exists in treatment engagement (Breland-Noble \\n& AAKOMA Project Adult Advisory Board, 2012; Breland-Noble, \\nBell, Burriss, & AAKOMA Project Adult Advisory Board, 2011), with \\npromising findings. However, considerably more research is need -\\ned to replicate current findings and establish the effectiveness of \\nengagement methods (Lindsey et al., 2014). And, research with \\nyouth of color must be based on an understanding of multicultural \\nconcerns as well as practical barriers that limit access to care.\\nChild/adolescent depression and suicide.  While adolescents who \\nexperience an episode of depression have a 30-fold increased risk of \\ndeaths by suicide (Brent, 1993; Brent et al., 1988), the suicide rates \\nfor children and adolescents have generally stabilized or declined \\nover the past 20 years (McLoughlin, Gould, & Malone, 2015). \\nAccording to Shain and colleagues’ (2016) analysis, the suicide rate \\nin teens decreased by 28% from 1990 to 2013. \\nEven though there is stability in rates of suicide among youth, \\nsuicide is the third leading cause of death for youth between the \\nages of 10 and 24 (CDC, 2017) as well as for Hispanic males ages 15 \\nto 34 (Suicide Prevention Resource Center, 2013) and Black youth \\nages 15 to 24 (Al-Mateen & Rogers, 2018). Depressive disorders are linked with increased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, \\nand completed suicides (Hatcher-Kay & King, 2003). The preva -\\nlence of seriously attempting suicide was higher among gay, les -\\nbian, and bisexual youth than their heterosexual counterparts \\n(42.8% and 14.8%, respectively; Frieden, Jaffe, Cono, Richards, \\n& Iademarco, 2016). Depression is a major risk factor for suicide \\nwith more than half of adolescent suicide victims reported to have \\na depressive disorder at time of death (Thapar et al., 2012). Rates \\nof suicide among Native American youth are the highest across all \\npopulations and are at epidemic levels (Herne, Bertholomew, & \\nWeahkee, 2014). According to the National Comorbidity Study—\\nAdolescent Supplement, nearly 30% of adolescents with major \\ndepressive disorder reported some form of suicidality in the past \\nyear, with 10.8% reporting a suicide attempt (Avenevoli et al., \\n2015). Thus, providing effective treatment for depression in youth \\nand reduction of access to lethal means might have a significant \\nimpact on preventing suicidal behavior and attempts in this age \\ngroup. \\nChild/adolescent depression and co-morbidity.  A large proportion of \\nchildren and adolescents with depression also meet criteria for comor -\\nbid psychiatric disorders, with the most common disorders including \\nanxiety and behavioral (conduct and oppositional defiant) disorders \\n(Avenevoli et al., 2015). Research has indicated that youth with pri -\\nmary depression, compared with youth with primary anxiety, are more \\nlikely to have other comorbidities (such as anxiety).  For example, \\nresearch over the past 10 years suggests that almost half of community \\nyouth with primary depression also meet criteria for anxiety disorders \\nwhile just under 20% of community youth with primary anxiety also \\nmeet criteria for a depressive disorder (Garber & Weersing, 2010). \\nAside from anxiety, other common psychiatric comorbidities present \\nin youth with primary depression include substance use and abuse (Curry & Hersch, 2016), sleep problems and attention-deficit/hyper -\\nactivity disorder (Becker, Langberg, & Evans, 2015).   \\nThere are also some reported sex differences in patterns of \\nconcurrent comorbidity, with some studies showing depression comorbid with conduct disorder in girls but not boys, and depres -\\nsion comorbid with substance use disorders in boys but not girls'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content='concurrent comorbidity, with some studies showing depression comorbid with conduct disorder in girls but not boys, and depres -\\nsion comorbid with substance use disorders in boys but not girls \\n(Costello, Mustillo, Erkanli, Keeler, & Angold, 2003).  However, \\nrecent research points to fewer sex differences and greater depres -\\nsive illness severity associated with likelihood of co-morbidity \\nequally between boys and girls (i.e., more severe major depres -\\nsive disorder is associated with presence of conduct and anxiety \\nproblems than less severe major depressive disorder in both sexes; \\nAvenevoli et al., 2015).  As shown earlier, depression was often \\nstudied as a secondary co-occurring disorder to other behavior \\nand mental health problems (i.e., conduct disorder and opposi -\\ntional defiant disorder) in youth of color. However, it is unlikely that \\nhigh representation of this research area shows greater likelihood \\nof externalizing behavior problems in depressed youth of color. \\nTherefore, future research is needed with large samples of youth of \\ncolor to determine actual correlation between disruptive behavior \\nproblems and the presence of major depressive disorder in racially \\ndiverse youth.   \\nFinally, physical health conditions, such as smoking, obesi-\\nty, and drug use (Conway, Swendsen, Husky, He, & Merikangas, \\n2016; Merikangas, Mendola, Pastor, Reuben, & Cleary, 2012) are \\nalso associated with depression that differs across racial groups. \\nOverall, the current body of research has suggested that youth \\nacross race and sex experience depression in consort with other \\nmental illnesses and that clinical interventions for depression may \\nneed to account for the presence of symptoms reflecting multiple mental illnesses in children and teens.\\nGeneral Adult Population \\nPrevalence among adults. Major depression is one of the most com -\\nmon mood disorders among young and middle-aged adults. \\nAccording to a 2014 report by the Substance Abuse and Mental \\nHealth Services Administration (SAMHSA), an estimated 15.7 mil-\\nlion adults in the United States aged 18 and older had at least one \\nmajor depressive episode during the past year. This represented \\n6.7% of all U.S. adults (SAMHSA, 2015).\\nIn addition, 4.3% of adults (10.2 million individuals) reported \\nexperiencing a major depressive episode with “severe impairment” \\n(SAMHSA, 2015). Severe impairment occurred if their depression \\nresulted in severe problems in their ability “to manage at home, \\nmanage well at work, have relationships with others, or have a \\nsocial life” (SAMHSA, 2015, p. 30). Among the U.S. adult popu -\\nlation, the highest percentage of individuals with a previous-year \\nmajor depressive episode occurred for young adults aged 18 to 25 \\n(9.3%). This was followed by adults aged 26 to 49 (7.2%) and then \\nby individuals older than 50 (5.2%). Regarding the experience of \\na major depressive episode leading to severe impairment, the age \\ngroup with the highest percentage of adults involved those aged 18 \\nto 25 (6.0%), followed by people aged 26 to 49 (4.6%) and per -\\nsons older than 50 (3.5%; SAMHSA, 2015).'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='APA\\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depression\\u2003 23Not only is depression pervasive, it also carries the heaviest \\nburden of disability among psychological disorders. Specifically, \\nmajor depression accounts for 3.7% of all U.S. disability-adjusted \\nlife years and 8.3% of all U.S. years lived with disability (National \\nInstitute of Mental Health, 2015). Worldwide, it is estimated that \\non average 1 in 20 people experienced a depressive episode in the \\nprevious year, affecting 350 million people (Marcus et al., 2012).\\nCharacteristics of depression in the general adult population: Sex \\ndifferences in adults. Across the world, women are approximately \\ntwice as likely to experience depression as men (Albert, 2015). For \\nexample, women have a lifetime prevalence for major depression of \\napproximately 21%, compared with 12% among men (Kessler et al., \\n1993). This sex difference appears early during adolescence. \\nExplanations for this difference include a variety of developmental, \\nbiological, cultural, and social causes (Albert, 2015). \\nRegardless of the reasons, the World Health Organization \\n(WHO) estimated that the burden of depression is approximately \\n50% higher for women than men (WHO, 2008). Moreover, it is the \\nleading cause of functional impairment for women regardless of \\nthe socioeconomic status of a given country. Of related concern is \\nthe notion that maternal depression, especially in developing coun -\\ntries, may be a risk factor for impoverished growth in young chil -\\ndren (Rahman, Patel, Maselko, & Kirkwood, 2008), underscoring \\nthe cross-generational impact of depression.\\nThere are also sex differences in the presentation of adult \\ndepression. For example, according to the National Institute of \\nMental Health (NIMH), women tend to have symptoms of sadness, \\nworthlessness, and guilt, whereas men are more likely to report \\nexperiencing tiredness, irritability, sleep problems, and loss of \\ninterest in previously pleasurable activities (NIMH, 2015).\\nAdult depression and race/ethnicity. Different depression prevalence \\nrates as a function of race and ethnicity have been identified. This relationship, however, can be somewhat complex. For example, while \\nlarge-scale studies tend to find that Blacks (e.g., African Americans, \\nCaribbean Blacks) have lower lifetime rates of major depressive dis -\\norder compared with non-Hispanic Whites, the chronicity and bur -\\nden of depression appears the opposite for these groups. Specifically, \\none study found that while lifetime major depressive disorder preva -\\nlence estimates were the highest for Whites, the chronicity of major \\ndepressive disorder for the Caribbean Black and African American \\nsamples was substantially higher than for Whites (Williams et al., \\n2007).  Moreover, both Black groups, in comparison to Whites, were \\nless likely to receive any form of psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy \\nfor depression and were more likely to rate their major depressive \\ndisorder as more severe and disabling.\\nOne concern involved in estimating difference in prevalence \\nrates as a function of race and ethnicity is to avoid “lumping” var -\\nious subgroups together. For example, 27% of a group of over \\n16,000 individuals of Hispanic/Latino origin reported elevated \\nlevels of depressive symptoms, but rates varied between 22.3% \\namong individuals of Mexican background to 38% among those of \\nPuerto Rican background (Wassertheil-Smoller et al., 2014). Also, \\ndespite similarities in ethnic background/heritage, an individu -\\nal’s location of birth may play a role in influencing differences in depression prevalence rates. One study found that prevalence rates \\nof depression among U.S. born Chinese Americans was much high -\\ner (21.5%) than that of non-U.S. born Chinese Americans (7.7%; \\nJackson et al., 2011).  Further, the prevalence rates of depression \\namong Asian Americans were higher than among Asians in Asia \\n(Yang & WonPat-Borja, 2007). An added concern in estimating dif -'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='Jackson et al., 2011).  Further, the prevalence rates of depression \\namong Asian Americans were higher than among Asians in Asia \\n(Yang & WonPat-Borja, 2007). An added concern in estimating dif -\\nferences in prevalence rates is that socioeconomic status and pov -\\nerty are not only independent predictors of depression, they are \\nalso strongly associated with race/ethnicity and depression (Riolo, \\nNguyen, Greden, & King, 2005).  Notably, in many places around \\nthe world, people of color (compared with Whites) are overrep -\\nresented in groups with less access to socioeconomic resources. \\nResearch that fully explores rates of depression among multicultur -\\nal and diverse populations inclusive of SES, gender identity, sexual \\norientation, cultural heritage, and geography is needed.\\nAdult depression and suicide.  It is estimated that approximately two \\nthirds of those in the United States who die by suicide suffer from \\ndepression at the time of the suicide act (CDC, 2012). Moreover, the \\nlikelihood for a lifetime suicide attempt has been estimated to be \\napproximately five times greater for individuals with major depres-\\nsive disorder or persistent depressive disorder compared with an \\nindividual without a diagnosis (Nock, Hwang, Sampson, & Kessler, \\n2010). Such statistics strongly underscore the need for adequate \\nassessment of the presence and degree of suicidality when working \\nwith depressed adults, the reduction of access to lethal means, and \\nthe need for effective depression treatment to reduce suicide.\\nAdult depression and comorbidity. Depressive symptoms and disor -\\nders are commonly associated with a wide range of other psychiatric \\nand medical disorders and diseases. These include anxiety, posttrau -\\nmatic stress disorder, substance use, personality disorders, heart dis -\\nease, cancer, multiple sclerosis, pain, dementia, and diabetes (e.g., \\nKaton et al., 2010; Richards & O’Hara, 2014; Simon et al., 2005). Such \\ncomorbidity can have significant impact on people’s health outcome \\nbeyond the disease itself. For example, depression among patients \\nwith diabetes is associated with higher risk of significant complications \\nsuch as amputation, blindness, and dementia (Katon et al., 2010; \\nSimon et al., 2005). Moreover, depression itself has been found to \\npredict comorbid medical diseases such as diabetes (Katon et al., \\n2010). Research has shown that among people without cardiovascular \\ndisease but depression at baseline, there is an approximately 200% \\nincrease in relative risk (or probability) of developing heart disease \\ncompared with nondepressed persons (Wulson & Singal, 2003). \\nAdditionally, depression is commonly reported in patients with HIV /AIDS (Rabkin, 2008).  The literature on the assessment and treatment \\nof diseases comorbid with depression is large and growing. \\nOlder Adult Population\\nPrevalence of depression in older adults. The prevalence rate of \\ndepression in the overall older adult population is estimated to be \\n2.6% (Haigh, Bogucki, Sigmon, & Blazer, 2016; Kessler et al., 2003).  \\nThe estimate point prevalence of major depression among older \\npatients ranges between 5%–10% in primary care settings and is'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='24\\u2003APA \\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depressionhigher still (10%–42%) among older patients in inpatient settings, \\nincluding long-term care (Blazer, 2003; Djernes, 2006; Schulberg, \\nKaton, Simon, & Rush, 1998). Epidemiological studies of late-life \\ndepression show that the prevalence of depression and of clinically \\nsignificant depressive symptoms increases with greater medical \\nburden/ comorbidity and disability. Subthreshold depression is 2–3 \\ntimes more common than major depression in older adults, and \\n8%–10% of those with subthreshold symptoms develop major \\ndepression each year (Meeks, Vahia, Lavretsky, Kulkarni, & Jeste, \\n2011).  Cognitive decline, age-associated neurobiological changes, \\nstressful events, and sleep disturbance are also risk factors for late-\\nlife depression (Fiske, Wetherell, & Gatz, 2010; Sözeri-Varma, 2012). \\nIt is also important to consider cohort differences in the prevalence, \\npresentation, and treatment of depression among older adults. For \\nexample, the issues of a typical young–old person in their 60s may \\nbe quite different than that of an older–old person in their 90s.\\nCharacteristics of depression in older adults. The clinical presenta-\\ntion of depression in older adults is also distinctive and, to an import -\\nant extent, differs from early periods in the life cycle by following a \\nrelapsing and recurrent course. Depression in older adults is often \\ntreatment resistant, that is, patients may improve partially but do not \\nremit symptomatically nor regain full functional status (Ng & \\nSchweitzer, 2002). Partial response, as marked by the presence of \\nresidual symptoms, is associated both with continuing disability, \\ncaregiver burden, and elevated risk for early relapse and recurrence. \\nThe literature on treatment resistance in older adults is still rather \\nsparse, but recent leads in the pharmacotherapy of treatment-resis -\\ntant depression are promising (Lenze et al., 2015). \\nSubsyndromal depression in old age is an important oppor -\\ntunity for early interventions to preempt the development of full-\\nblown clinical depression. Learning-based interventions and those \\nthat are behaviorally activating (e.g., behavioral activation, cogni -\\ntive-behavioral therapy, problem-solving therapy) are a promising \\nmethod of depression prevention (with a focus on mildly symp -\\ntomatic people; Reynolds et al., 2014). These interventions are \\nalso amenable for outreach to, and effective in, low-income older \\nAfrican Americans (Reynolds et al., 2014).\\nOlder adult depression and race/ethnicity.  The growth in the nation’s \\nolder population is characterized also by increasing racial and ethnic \\ndiversity and the need for preventive and treatment interventions \\nthat are culturally appropriate. Models employing lay health counsel -\\nors of similar ethnic and racial backgrounds to the patient increas -\\ningly seem to be a rational and cost-effective use of resources to \\nreach diverse racial and ethnic groups in underserved and disadvan -\\ntaged older adults (Patel et al., 2010). \\nTreatment accessibility and use can vary among older adults of \\ndiffering ethnic backgrounds. Such disparities in treatment accessi -\\nbility and/or use have been attributed to financial hardship, unique \\npresentations of depressive symptoms, culturally based mistrust of \\nproviders, negative attitudes about seeking mental health care (e.g., \\nfeelings of shame/guilt), anticipated or previously experienced rac -\\nism or discrimination in treatment settings, language barriers, and \\nthe limited accessibility of ethnically diverse mental health profes -\\nsionals (Conner et al., 2010; Unützer et al., 2003). However, more research is needed to understand other groups of people of color \\nand people of color across socioeconomic strata.\\nOlder adult depression and suicide.

Increasing the accessibility and utilization \\nof care for depression in older adults as well as all age populations \\nand reducing access to highly lethal means (e.g., firearms) are key \\nstrategies for reducing proximal risk factors for suicide.\\nOlder adult depression and comorbidity. Although core symptoms \\nare the same as in the general adult population (e.g., low mood and anhedonia), depression in older adults typically co-occurs with often \\nchronic medical disorders, amplifying disability (Lin et al., 2003). For example, Lin and colleagues (2003) found that enhancing care for \\ndepression was related to lower levels of pain as well as higher qual -\\nity of life and functional status among a diverse sample of older \\nadults with comorbid depression and arthritis. Further, depression in \\nolder adults either coexists with or foreshadows the development of cognitive impairment and dementia (Butters et al., 2004; Diniz, \\nButters, Albert, Dew, & Reynolds, 2013). For example, in a meta-anal -\\nysis, Diniz and colleagues (2013) found a link between depression in \\nolder adults and risk of dementia, including both Alzheimer’s disease \\nand vascular dementia. This risk was particularly high for vascular \\ndementia compared with Alzheimer’s disease. These signature \\ncomorbidities of late-life depression complicate its management and \\nneed to be addressed in treatment planning.\\nTreatment issues in older adults. Many older adults prefer psycho -\\nsocial treatments to pharmacotherapy for depression (Hanson & \\nScogin, 2008; Raue, Schulberg, Heo, Klimstra, & Bruce, 2009). \\nMultiple factors influence these preferences including insurance \\ncoverage, availability of specific treatments, transportation, and \\nreduced patient mobility and make input from patients and families \\nimportant. In depression treatments, older adults with depression, as \\nwell as their family caregivers, define treatment goals in terms of well-being and return of functional status and engagement in key \\nsocial and familial roles (Lebowitz et al., 1997).  It is often difficult, \\nhowever, to provide psychosocial treatment, given the paucity of \\nspecialty-trained providers to treat depression in older adults, espe -\\ncially in primary care settings. Primary care settings remain the \\nprincipal locus where treatment of late-life depression takes place. \\nAt any one point in time, it is estimated that 6%–10% of older patients \\nin primary care settings qualify for a diagnosis of current major \\ndepressive episode and another 10%–20% have subsyndromal \\nsymptoms that are disabling and that pose risk for conversion to \\nmajor depression. To some extent the locus of care reflects patient \\nand family preferences, as well as stigma against mental health spe -\\ncialty referral. The challenge here is to identify models of evi-\\ndence-based depression care management that are transferrable to \\nand practical within primary care settings (e.g., Improving Mood-\\nPromoting Access to Collaborative Treatment [IMPACT] interven -\\ntion; Unützer et al., 2002); and Prevention of Suicide in Primary Care \\nElderly: Collaborative Trial [PROSPECT]; Bruce et al., 2004). There \\nis considerable progress in the development and implementation of'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content='APA\\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depression\\u2003 25collaborative care models for both treatment and prevention. In low \\nresource countries, such as India, progress is also evident in the \\ndevelopment of models that use lay health counsellors for the imple-\\nmentation of depression treatment and prevention programs (e.g., \\nthe MANAS trial in Goa; Patel et al., 2010). Many frail, homebound \\nolder adults who have symptoms of depression and cognitive impair -\\nment have difficulties in obtaining appropriate care. Programs for \\nreaching out to this particularly vulnerable population have been \\ndeveloped, together with pathways to implementation of appropri -\\nate treatment (Scogin, Moss, Harris, & Presnell, 2014; Sirey, Hannon, \\nD’Angelo, & Knies, 2012). Family and psychoeducational interven-\\ntions may be particularly useful in reaching diverse older adults. As \\nsuch, a public health and clinical priority in optimizing care for older \\nadults is identifying psychosocial treatments that are effective across \\ndiverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups; can be carried out \\nin general medical settings (such as problem-solving therapy; \\nUnützer et al., 2002); and are sensitive to culturally specific experi -\\nences and beliefs of diverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. \\nThe Need for a Clinical Practice Guideline and \\nDecisions about Scope and Goals of the Clinical \\nPractice Guideline\\nAvailable treatment guidelines for the problem.   Given the evidence \\nthat depression is a disorder whose cost and burden justify extensive \\nefforts at intervention, providers need access to information that will \\nhelp guide intervention. While there is now a substantial body of \\nresearch literature examining a broad range of approaches to assess -\\nment and treatment (including psychotherapeutic, pharmacologic, \\nand other interventional approaches), studies have indicated that of \\nthose who receive treatment, between 30% (Teh et al., 2010) and \\n59% (Kessler et al., 2003) do not receive a minimally adequate dose \\nof treatment (as defined by Kessler et al., 2003 on p. 3098). Some \\nsubpopulations are at even higher risk for failure to receive adequate \\ntreatment (i.e., African Americans and individuals who begin their \\ndepression treatment with an inpatient hospitalization for depres -\\nsion; Teh et al., 2010).  These findings strongly demonstrate the need \\nfor providers, consumers, and health care systems to have access to \\nguidelines that provide information about effective treatment options \\nas well as a focused application of dissemination and implementa -\\ntion science. \\nFortunately, there have been several guideline develop -\\nment efforts addressing major depression, including the National \\nInstitute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline in the \\nUnited Kingdom (NICE, 2009), the Department of Veterans \\nAffairs/Department of Defense (2016) guideline, and the American \\nPsychiatric Association (2010). How the current guideline comple -\\nments these prior efforts is discussed on p. 72.\\n34  Of not e, as of March 2016, the division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies) formerly known as Institute of \\nMedicine (IOM) was renamed the National Academy of Medicine (NAM). Despite the recent name change, the guideline will use IOM when referring to the IOM stan-\\ndards for guideline development and systematic reviews.The APA Clinical Practice Guideline for the \\nTreatment of the Problem \\nIn considering how the current guideline development could comple -\\nment the existing knowledge base, the guideline development panel \\nhad several overarching goals.

In addition, \\nthe panel identified the need to include psychotherapeutic interven-\\ntions. In considering prior guidelines, they either provided limited \\nguidance on psychotherapies or had been completed 5 years or more \\nprior and there was a need for an updated review of the literature \\n(following IOM [2011b] standards). One exception is the Department \\nof Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense guideline focused on \\nveteran and military populations, which was completed while this \\nguideline was in development and whose underlying systematic \\nreview has been drawn on to support this current effort.\\nWhat the current guideline provides beyond existing ones.  This \\nclinical practice guideline differs in substantive ways from others that \\nare currently available. This guideline is predicated on the three \\ndimensions mentioned in the American Psychological Association \\nPresidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice (2006): (1) \\ngrounding in the best available science; (2) practitioner expertise in \\napplication decisions; and (3) patient expertise regarding their pref -\\nerences, culture, and values. These three areas were consistent with earlier work by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and are areas that \\nare universally accepted in medicine. In addition, the steering com-\\nmittee and panel made every effort to fully apply the standards set \\nforth by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies of \\nSciences, Engineering, and Medicine for developing independent, \\nreliable, and high-quality clinical practice guidelines (IOM, 2011a; \\nIOM, 2011b).\\n34 This document goes beyond previous treatment of \\ndepression guidelines and literature in the following important ways: \\n(a) involvement of consumer (patient) stakeholders as panel mem -\\nbers in addition to professionals from multiple disciplines involved in \\nthe delivery of the treatment of depression; (b) use of procedures for \\nidentifying and managing real and potential conflicts of interest \\n(COIs) throughout the guideline development process that required \\nall panel members to routinely disclose all conflicts of interest; (c) \\nidentification of patient values and preferences through review of \\npublished research literature and input from consumer members of \\nthe panel; (d) identification of harms and burdens of treatments \\nthrough review of published research literature and input of consum -\\ners and clinician members of the panel in evaluating those harms and \\nburdens; (e) the use of decision-table (for older adults) and grid (for \\ngeneral adults and children/ adolescents) templates to systematically \\nguide panel members in the development of recommendations that'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content='26\\u2003APA \\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depressiontake into account the strength of the research evidence for benefits and \\nharms, the relative balance of treatment benefit versus treatment \\nharm, the values and preferences of patients, and applicability. \\nFor the general adult population, the panel used an indepen -\\ndent, newly released, systematic review of the depression treat -\\nment literature that provided clearly specified inclusion and exclu -\\nsion criteria, a standard method for grading risk of bias of individual studies and strength of evidence for bodies of evidence. The sys -\\ntematic review was supplemented by a review of existing reviews \\nas well as meta-analyses to provide more comprehensive coverage \\nof the literature. The panel used existing meta-analyses of the child \\nand adolescent literature that were identified by panel members, and all existing meta-analyses and reviews were evaluated using \\nthe same AMSTAR (a measurement tool to assess systematic \\nreviews; Shea et al., 2007) quality criteria.\\nInstitute of Medicine (IOM) standards as the basis for this clinical \\npractice guideline. Another goal of the panel was to take a method -\\nologically rigorous approach to guideline development, following the current IOM recommendations (IOM, 2011a). This, however, led to one of the more significant challenges in the guideline development \\nprocess. The systematic reviews conducted by the evidence-based practice centers met IOM criteria but excluded bodies of literature \\nbecause of inadequate quality, yet such exclusions meant some of \\nthe panel’s key questions were not addressed. Rather than not \\naddress those questions, the panel chose to modify its criteria for \\nsystematic reviews and include manuscripts that had used a single \\nrather than dual review process to evaluate articles for inclusion in \\nthe review (i.e., one reviewer vs. two for article inclusion) but other -\\nwise met all IOM requirements. The consequence is a less method -\\nologically rigorous systematic review because there is an increased \\nrisk of bias in the choice of journal articles (Edwards et al., 2002; IOM, \\n2011b). However, key questions could not have been answered oth -\\nerwise. The single reviewer in each of the three meta-analyses utiliz -\\ning single review was panel member and lead author of these \\npublished meta-analyses, Dr. Pim Cuijpers. To reduce potential COI, \\nas noted each of these reviews was independently analyzed with \\nAMSTAR prior to use by the panel. The panel is therefore able to \\naddress these questions but does so with proper precautions about \\nthe literature on which the recommendations are based.\\nShared versus unique contributions of different psychotherapy \\nmodels. A fourth goal was to attempt to address the issue of shared \\nversus unique contributions of different psychotherapy models. Most \\nof the psychotherapy treatment literature examines specifically \\ndefined models. However, there is a growing body of literature suggest -\\ning that shared aspects (common factors [e.g., hope, expectancy, \\ntherapeutic alliance]) of interventions (Norcross, 2011) relative to \\nmodel-specific components are germane to optimal treatment out -\\ncomes (regardless of the therapeutic orientation implemented). An \\nanalysis of treatments for major depression found evidence consistent \\nwith this (Cuijpers, Driessen, Hollon et al., 2012a).  In addition, the \\ndefinitions of treatments in articles and reviews varied greatly. Further, \\n35  T he AHRQ (an agency that works within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) strives to improve health care by enhancing access to the relevant evidence \\nbases in collaboration with partners.in some reviews, treatments were grouped that were arguably not part \\nof the shared family of interventions, reducing panel confidence in consistency across treatment comparisons and judgments about spe -\\ncific contributions of distinct psychotherapies.

Thus, the panel was not \\nable to realize this goal but makes recommendations for future \\nresearch that explicitly addresses the shared components of effective psychotherapy, the necessity of appropriately defining treatments, \\nand newer models of the treatment of depression. Further discussion \\nof this topic is provided in the Discussion section. \\nGuideline recommendations for underserved populations. Similarly, \\na fifth goal was to provide appropriate guideline recommendations \\nfor underserved populations. However, it was immediately apparent \\nthat randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the reviews had \\nlimited information available to inform recommendations for such \\npopulations. While the panel made extensive efforts to draw guid-\\nance from the literature available, the limitations of that literature \\nmade clear to the panel the need for a vigorous call for increased \\ndedication to RCTs specifically studying diverse samples. Of note, \\nthe limitations of the literature highlighted the need for funding agen -\\ncies and investigators to explicitly address differences, in particular, culture, ethnicity, sex, sexual minority, gender identity, disability, \\nnationality of origin, generation status, race, socioeconomic status, \\nand others, as well as the intersection of these variables, which can \\nfurther influence treatment. These are areas that could contribute to \\nthe experience and treatment of depression but for which the panel \\ndid not have an adequate literature to address.\\nFinally, arising from these last two goals, the panel was deter -\\nmined to develop a series of recommendations for future research \\nto address the gaps and limitations in the literature that were \\nobserved. The panel’s goal is that this guideline serves as a current \\nand functional tool to guide providers, health care systems, and \\nconsumers in decision-making regarding treatment and provides \\ninvestigators guidance on key clinical research questions that are \\nnecessary to address so that all can meaningfully improve the abil -\\nity to treat this pervasive and debilitating disorder. \\nGuideline Purpose and Scope: What the \\nGuideline Does and Does Not Address\\nThe purpose of this guideline is to provide recommendations on the \\ntreatment of depression in three developmental cohorts: children and \\nadolescents; general population of adults; and older adults. This guide -\\nline is based on several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the \\nevidence on treatment of depression, two of which were sponsored by \\nthe Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ)35 and con-\\nducted by the Research Triangle Institute–University of North Carolina \\n(RTI-UNC) Evidence-Based Practice Center (Gartlehner et al., 2015) \\nand the ECRI Institute (2015). The other reviews were independently \\nconducted by teams of researchers (Cipriani et al., 2016; Cuijpers, \\nDriessen, et al., 2012a; Cuijpers, Karyotaki, Pot, et al., 2014a; Cuijpers,'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='APA\\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depression\\u2003 27Koole, et al., 2014b; Cuijpers et al., 2016, Driessen et al., 2015; Wilkinson \\n& Izmeth, 2012; Zhou et al., 2015). \\nThis guideline attempted to address the following four key questions36:\\n1.

The panel used data from several reviews \\nand meta-analyses that met quality criteria. The panel used two \\nsystematic reviews conducted by Evidence-Based Practice Centers, \\nwhich follow quality standards for conducting systematic reviews set \\nforth by the former Institute of Medicine (2011b) report. The first of \\nthese focused on comparisons of pharmacological treatments with \\nnonpharmacological treatments (Gartlehner et al., 2015) while the \\nsecond covered a broad range of treatment comparisons (ECRI \\nInstitute, 2015). The Veteran’s Administration/Department of \\nDefense (VA/DoD) utilized the latter in their creation of a clinical \\npractice guideline, and the review was used by this panel with per -\\nmission. This systematic review for the VA/DoD included as data \\npreviously published systematic reviews as well as clinical studies. \\nGartlehner and colleagues (2015) defined depression in adults ages \\n18 and older who received diagnoses of major depressive disorder \\nfrom a standardized diagnostic manual or from elevated scores on \\nvalidated instruments. For more information on the inclusion/ exclu -\\nsion criteria used in this review, please refer to Gartlehner et al.’s \\n(2015) Table A. Inclusion/exclusion criteria  (pp. ES-3 to ES-5). The VA/\\nDoD guideline developers defined depression in adults age 18 or older having received a first diagnosis of major depression, currently \\nreceiving treatment for depression, and adults with chronic depres -\\nsion in a VA/DoD setting (ECRI Institute, 2015).

For more informa -\\ntion on the inclusion/ exclusion criteria used for this review, please \\nrefer to the VA/DoD’s section Methods of Systematic Review: Study \\nSelection Criteria (p. 5). \\nThe panel then used four additional AMSTAR evaluated \\nmeta-analyses to supplement the reviews. The first focused on nondirective supportive psychotherapy (Cuijpers, Driessen, et \\nal., 2012a), and the second focused on subclinical depression \\n(Cuijpers, Koole, et al., 2014b). Cuijpers, Driessen, and colleagues \\n(2012a) defined depression as adults who received a diagnosis of \\nmajor depressive disorder from either a diagnostic interview or a \\nvalidated self-report measure.  For the inclusion/exclusion crite -\\nria of selecting the studies for this review, please refer to Cuijpers, \\nReynolds, et al.’s (2012b) section 2.1 Identification and selection of \\nstudies  (pp. 281–282). The authors of the second review defined \\ndepression as either having scores above the threshold on a vali -\\ndated questionnaire or meeting the standardized diagnostic crite -\\nria for minor depression (Cuijpers, Koole, et al., 2014b). To review \\nthe authors’ inclusion/exclusion criteria for selecting studies in this \\nreview, please refer to Cuijpers, Koole, et al.’s (2014b) Method sec -\\ntion (pp. 268–269). The third review focused on short-term psy -\\nchodynamic psychotherapy (Driessen et al., 2015), and the fourth \\nfocused on interpersonal psychotherapy (Cuijpers et al., 2016). \\nThe authors of the third review defined depression in adults ages 18 \\nand older that either met the diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder, \\nspecifically major depressive disorder, or had elevated scores on \\na validated instrument (Driessen et al., 2015). For the inclusion/\\nexclusion criteria utilized in this review, please refer to Driessen et \\nal.’s (2015) section 2.3 Selection of studies  (p. 3). The authors of the \\nfinal review defined depression as elevated scores on a validated \\ninstrument pre- and posttreatment (Cuijpers et al., 2016).

The panel used two reviews identified via the umbrella \\nreview.

Authors of \\nthe first review defined depression in older adults ages 50 and older \\nwho either met the diagnostic criteria for depression at assessment \\nor had ratings beyond the threshold in a validated self-report mea -\\nsure (Cuijpers, Karyotaki, Pot, et al., 2014a).

Also, while the panel wished to \\nreview different treatment modalities, including self-help, Internet, \\nand group compared with individual, appropriate studies were \\nnot included in the identified reviews to be able to examine this \\nquestion. The panel did not evaluate evidence reviews of long-term \\nintervention to target relapse and recurrence and evidence reviews \\nof prevention intervention, consistent with its scoping decision.\\nTABLE 5  \\nSummary of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Used for Each Age Group\\nAge Group Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Used\\nChildren and Adolescents • “Comparative efficacy and acceptability of psychotherapies for depression in children and adolescents: A \\nsystematic review and network meta-analysis” (Zhou et al., 2015) \\n• “Comparative efficacy and tolerability of antidepressants for major depressive disorder in children and \\nadolescents: A network meta-analysis” (Cipriani et al., 2016)\\nGeneral Adult Population • “Nonpharmacological versus pharmacological treatments for adult patients with major depressive disorder” \\n(Gartlehner et al., 2015)\\n• “Management of major depressive disorder, Evidence synthesis report, Clinical practice guideline” (ECRI \\nInstitute, 2015)\\n• “The efﬁcacy of non-directive supportive psychotherapy for adult depression: A meta-analysis” (Cuijpers, \\nDriessen, et al., 2012a)\\n• “Psychotherapy for subclinical depression: Meta-analysis“ (Cuijpers, Koole, et al., 2014b)\\n• “The efﬁcacy of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for depression: A meta-analysis update” (Driessen \\net al., 2015)\\n• “Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Mental Health Problems: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis” (Cuijpers et al., \\n2016)\\nOlder Adults • “Managing depression in older age: Psychological interventions” (Cuijpers Karyotaki, Pot, et al., 2014a) \\n• “Continuation and maintenance treatments for depression in older people” (Wilkinson & Izmeth, 2012)'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='32\\u2003APA \\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of DepressionStrengths and Limitations of the Systematic \\nReviews and Meta-Analyses\\nThere are a number of strengths as well as some limitations of the \\nsystematic reviews and meta-analyses underlying the panel’s recom-\\nmendations. The two systematic reviews conducted by evi -\\ndence-based practice centers (ECRI Institute, 2015; Gartlehner et al., \\n2015) (two of five used for the general adult population) had import -\\nant strengths as well as limitations. First, they were conducted in \\naccordance with the IOM’s (2011b) systematic review standards by \\ndesignated Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) \\nevidence-based practice centers. Further, both reviews are transpar -\\nent in including background data as well as strength of evidence and \\nrisk of bias information. However, some limitations of these reviews \\nincluded that there were some areas not covered (as noted above) \\non which the panel would have liked information and the focus of \\nboth was only on major depressive disorder, thus the panel had to \\nlook elsewhere for information on additional diagnoses. \\nThe reviews for older adults (Cuijpers Karyotaki, Pot, et al., \\n2014a; Wilkinson & Izmeth, 2012) were examined by RTI-UNC \\nEvidence Based Practice Center scientists who then extracted \\ndata from these reviews into evidence profiles for the panel to use. \\nStrengths of the Wilkinson and Izmeth (2012) review include that it \\nfocused on a population that is understudied and focused on longer \\nterm continuation and maintenance treatment as opposed to the \\nshorter term acute focus of most older adult reviews (Wilkinson \\n& Izmeth, 2012). The authors of the review noted that there was a \\nsignificant amount of clinical heterogeneity between trials. Further, \\nit is possible that there was selection bias (i.e., given challenges \\nof recruiting older adults, it is possible that those recruited do not \\nfully represent older adults in the general population) as well as \\npossible funding bias (the authors were not able to analyze data on \\nthis possibility as data were not collected) in the included studies \\n(Wilkinson & Izmeth, 2012). However, the authors concluded that \\naltogether the studies had low risk of bias (Wilkinson & Izmeth, \\n2012). Strengths of the Cuijpers, Karyotaki, Pot, et al. (2014a) \\nreview include that it focuses on an understudied population and provides an update of the literature in an area that is quickly chang -\\ning. Some limitations of this review are that many included studies \\nthat were not of ideal quality, and few included studies used control \\ngroups that were placebos (most used treatment as usual or wait -\\ning list comparisons; Cuijpers, Karyotaki, Pot, et al., 2014a). \\nAmong the reviews that were not provided or assessed by \\nan evidence-based practice center (Cipriani et al., 2016; Cuijpers, \\nDriessen, et al., 2012a; Cuijpers, Koole, et al., 2014b; Cuijpers et al., \\n2016; Driessen et al., 2015; and Zhou et al., 2015) (two for the child/\\nadolescent population, the remainder for the general adult popula -\\ntion) there were a number of strengths as well as some limitations. \\nBased on an AMSTAR review, strengths of all these reviews were \\nthat they included a comprehensive literature search; provided \\ncharacteristics of the included studies; an assessment of quality \\nwas conducted, documented, and used in conclusions; and finally, \\nthe methods used to combine findings were appropriate. Further \\nstrengths are that five of the six did not base inclusion on publica -\\ntion status and also assessed for likelihood of publication bias. A \\nlimitation of all but one of these reviews is that they did not provide a list of studies that were included and excluded. Beyond these, \\nlimitations varied based on the particular review and included such \\nthings as not duplicating the selection of studies and extraction of \\ndata, not having study design a priori, and not stating conflicts of'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='things as not duplicating the selection of studies and extraction of \\ndata, not having study design a priori, and not stating conflicts of \\ninterest (see Appendix H for details of AMSTAR ratings by review). \\nIn summary, each review used by the panel has strengths as \\nwell as limitations. Importantly, a review is not a final statement \\nand has its own limits, but it allows the field to obtain a better han -\\ndle on what information is lacking and what needs to be done in \\nthe future (e.g., more funding, better quality research, more focus \\non diverse populations, etc.). Information from these reviews was considered together with information on strength of the evidence \\nbase, balance of the benefits vs. harms/burdens of a treatment, \\npatient values and preferences, and applicability to form the pan -\\nel’s recommendations. In light of these limitations, it needs to be \\nrecognized that any recommendations made are based on evi -\\ndence derived by a method with some drawbacks for psychothera -\\npy research. Psychotherapy research differs in nature from medical research both in the number of variables effecting outcomes and \\nthe amount of research that met IOM standards. Results should \\ntherefore be read as best evidence according to method used and \\nviewed as a guideline not a prescription for treatment funding and \\ndecision-making.  \\nCharacterizing the Study Samples Included in \\nthe Reviews\\nDecisions regarding assessment and inclusion/exclusion of studies. \\nDecisions on the assessment and inclusion/ exclusion of studies varied \\nbased on the particular systematic review/meta-analysis. Please refer \\nto the systematic reviews/meta-analyses for specific details. However, \\nbroadly, the reviews included only randomized controlled trial (RCT) \\nstudies (Driessen et al.’s, 2015 review was an exception to this because \\nit included non-RCT data in addition to RCT data; however, the APA \\npanel used only the RCT data to examine efficacy of interventions) as \\nthose studies met the quality criteria for questions regarding efficacy. \\nSome reviews excluded certain diagnoses such as psychotic depres -\\nsion and required that the included studies be published in particular \\nlanguages. Several reviews included studies that had patients with \\ncomorbidities such as other psychiatric disorders. Please refer to the \\nsection on comorbidities for further detail. \\nDiversity of samples included in reviews. The reviews used to \\nexplore the effectiveness of treatments for depression in children and \\nadolescents are comprised of 51 studies examining psychotherapies \\n(Zhou et al., 2015) and 27 studies examining antidepressants \\n(Cipriani et al., 2016). These studies included ages ranging from 6 to \\n18 years of age and, out of the studies with available data, 75 studies \\nfor children and adolescents had approximately 50% female. Also, \\nstudies included international samples with approximately 85% of samples from United States. The non-U.S.-based samples included \\nMexico, Finland, France, Germany, Russia, Slovakia, Estonia, Ukraine, \\nSouth Africa, Belgium, Italy, United Kingdom, Spain, The Netherlands, Canada, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Japan, China, Costa Rica, India, Uganda, Turkey, Norway, New Zealand, Australia,'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='APA\\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depression\\u2003 33and Greece. Overall, of the studies with available data, 63 studies for \\nchildren and adolescents had a range of 10% to 100% of non-White \\nparticipants. Regarding study exclusions in each of the respective \\nchild/ adolescent reviews, the Zhou et al. (2015) excluded clinical \\ntrials where children and adolescents had a diagnosis of treat -\\nment-resistant depression or psychotic depression in order to elimi-\\nnate extraneous noise in their results. \\nThe reviews used for general adult population included 482 \\nstudies exploring psychotherapies and medication in this popula -\\ntion (Cuijpers, Driessen, et al., 2012a; Cuijpers, Koole, et al., 2014b; \\nDriessen et al., 2015; ECRI Institute, 2015; Gartlehner et al., 2015) \\nand 84 studies for medication. These studies included individ -\\nuals between 18 to greater than 65 years of age and are 70.7% \\nfemale. Also, studies included international samples with approx -\\nimately 38% of samples from United States. The non-U.S.-based \\nsamples include Canada, Iran, Switzerland, Italy, United Kingdom, \\nGermany, The Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Chile, Mexico, Spain, Brazil, China, and Romania. The review that \\nassessed efficacy of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for \\ndepression included 35 RCTs (Driessen et al., 2015). Overall, in the \\nstudies with available data, general adult population had approxi -\\nmately 50% of non-White participants. \\nFinally, the combined reviews for older adults included 53 \\nstudies for psychotherapies and medication (Cuijpers, Karyotaki, \\nPot, et al., 2014a; Wilkinson & Izmeth, 2012). The samples within \\nthe reviews included adults ages 50 and older with approximately \\n83% females across all studies. Reviews had limited internation -\\nal representation compared with the other age groups with sam -\\nples from the following countries: Singapore, The Netherlands, \\nGermany, Switzerland, Spain, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, \\nUnited States, Denmark, and various European countries. Of the \\nstudies in the reviews with reported data, the sample included only \\na range of 6.7% to 100% of non-White participants.\\n44\\nComorbidity of samples included in the reviews: Children and ado -\\nlescents. The reviews for depression in children and adolescents did \\nnot exclude comorbid psychiatric disorders. However, there were a \\nfew limitations noted in these reviews. Regarding the review that \\nassessed the efficacy of interpersonal psychotherapy adapted for adolescents (IPT-A) versus cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treat -\\nment of child/ adolescent depression, Zhou and colleagues (2015) \\nfound that the studies that recruited patients with comorbid psychi -\\natric disorders had lower effect sizes.\\n45 The authors emphasized the \\nneed for more research on the efficacy of IPT-A and cognitive-behav -\\nioral therapy in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders due to \\nthe small samples sizes that may have contributed to this finding \\n(Zhou et al., 2015).

Four out of the six reviews of depression in \\nthe general adult population did not exclude comorbid psychiatric \\nand medical disorders (Cuijpers, Driessen, et al., 2012a; Cuijpers, \\nKoole, et al., 2014b; ECRI Institute, 2015; Gartlehner et al., 2015).46 \\nReviewers from the ECRI Institute (2015) included the following \\ncomorbid psychiatric and medical disorders in one of their key ques -\\ntions: cardiovascular disease, dementia, arrythmias, seizure disor -\\nders, lower back pain, Alzheimer’s, and stroke. Regarding the review \\nof short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (Driessen et al., 2015), \\nthe reviewers did not consider comorbid somatic disorders. While \\nGartlehner and colleagues (2015) searched for studies that had \\ncomorbidity as an inclusion criterion, they noted the paucity of \\nhigh-quality studies that included patients with comorbid psychiatric \\nand medical disorders in most of the studies.\\nOlder adult population.

However, Cuijpers, Karyotaki, Pot, and col -\\nleagues (2014a) as well as Wilkinson and Izmeth (2012)47 were \\nunable to find studies that included older adults with depression as \\nwell as comorbid medical and psychiatric disorders in clinical trials. \\nBoth reviews emphasized the need for future research to include \\ncomorbid disorders in assessing treatment efficacy for depression in older adults.\\nDefining Efficacy and Comparative \\nEffectiveness\\nIn this guideline, the term efficacy refers to the impact of a treatment \\ncompared with an inactive control (i.e., waitlist).

Evidence profiles (summaries \\nof data in available studies) were created by the RTI-UNC Evidence-\\nBased Practice Center team from data reported in the systematic \\nreviews on the efficacy of psychological treatments and the compar -\\native effectiveness of psychological treatments to pharmacological \\ntreatments in head-to-head trials for older adults. The evidence \\nprofiles were summaries of data included in the systematic reviews \\nand include, for each outcome, the number of studies, absolute effect \\nsizes, confidence intervals (when available), and strength of evidence \\nratings.  For adults, evidence profiles were provided in the report \\n“Nonpharmacological Versus Pharmacological Treatments for Adult \\nPatients With Major Depressive Disorder,” (Gartlehner et al., 2015). \\nThe panel worked with data directly from the report for the remainder \\nof the systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Thus, the panel had \\nevidence profiles for some but not all of the data. Evidence profiles \\n(in the format provided by the Grading of Recommendations \\nAssessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Consortium \\nWorking Group in particular) typically have information beyond \\neffect size, such as information about the quality of included aggre -\\ngated studies for a particular outcome, which is not always the case \\nfor data taken directly from other systematic reviews or meta-anal -\\nyses. So, in some cases the panel had additional quality information \\nfor particular outcomes included in the evidence profiles but did not \\nhave that data for all interventions and outcomes. \\nThe development and use of decision tables and the grid.  Decision \\ntables and grids are documents developed and then used by panel \\nmembers to summarize and evaluate the evidence generated in the \\nsystematic review or meta-analyses, along with any supplemental \\ninformation. Panel ratings and judgments were documented on the \\ndecision tables and grids to aid in the formulation of recommenda-\\ntions (Treweek et al., 2013). These tables allow panel members to \\ndocument decisions, compare consistency across decisions, and give \\ntransparency to reviewers and users of the guideline document. The \\nfour main domains of decision-making are documented as follows: \\n(1) strength of evidence; (2) treatment outcomes and the balance of \\nbenefits vs. harms and burdens of interventions; (3) patient values \\nand preferences; and (4) applicability of the evidence to various \\ntreatment populations. \\nStrength of evidence was rated as either insufficient/very \\nlow, low, moderate, or high based on the combined results of anal -\\nyses of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision. \\nOnly for interventions that had at least low strength of evidence \\nfor one of the outcomes were decision tables or grids completed. \\nThe panel generated evidence that met the criteria for the com -\\npletion of 38 decision tables and three grids on which to base the \\nAPA Depression Guideline. While APA staff prepared the decision \\ntables and grids for the panel based on information extracted from the reviews and studies, the panel made all the decisions regarding the evidence and recommendations. Specifically, APA staff insert -\\ned information from the reviews and studies on quality ratings, out -\\ncomes examined and associated effect sizes, harms and burdens of \\ninterventions (as described in more detail below), study results on \\npatient values and preferences, and study participant descriptions the panel might want to reference for discussions on applicability. \\nAs the panel discussed each decision table or grid, APA staff tran -\\nscribed the panel’s decisions into each decision table or grid.  \\nAs the panel progressed with its work, they decided that the \\ncreation and review of evidence in decision tables resulted in redun -\\ndancy as the same information concerning possible harms and bur -'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='As the panel progressed with its work, they decided that the \\ncreation and review of evidence in decision tables resulted in redun -\\ndancy as the same information concerning possible harms and bur -\\ndens or patient values and preferences was considered repeatedly \\nfor different bodies of outcome evidence. To facilitate decision \\nmaking yet maintain consistency and transparency, a revised “grid” process was created that included distinct columns for separate \\nquestions and outcomes and individual decision-making regarding \\nefficacy but allowed consideration of the same data for harms and \\nburdens across those columns. This greatly increased the efficiency \\nof the evidence review while keeping consistency and transparency.\\nAlthough some have questioned the applicability of some \\nrandomized trials due to potential differences between sample \\ncharacteristics or treatment settings and the “real world” appli -\\ncation (Shean, 2016), the panel decided to not supplement the \\nrandomized trials included in the reviews with observational (i.e., nonrandomized and less methodologically rigorous) or other treat -\\nment studies, due to the potential for confounding bias in observa -\\ntional studies (Fewell, Smith, & Sterne, 2007; Rothman, Greenland, \\n& Lash, 2008). This decision is consistent with the position of all \\nmajor organizations that evaluate research and conduct system -\\natic reviews, including GRADE, Cochrane, The National Institute \\nfor Health and Care Excellence (NICE), The Agency for Healthcare \\nResearch and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-Based Practice Centers \\n(Guyatt et al., 2011; NICE, 2012; Reeves, Deeks, Higgins, & Wells on \\nbehalf of the Cochrane Non-Randomised Studies Methods Group, \\n2011; Viswanathan et al., 2012). \\nPanel members made two significant exceptions to this deci-\\nsion when it became clear that data were lacking in randomized \\ntrials findings on two outcomes: (1) harms and burdens of psycho -\\nlogical treatments and (2) patient values and preferences regard -\\ning particular treatments. In response, the panel decided there \\nwas a need to gather and review more information on these topics. \\nConcerning harms, panel members decided to review those obser -\\nvational studies that gave attention to the assessment of harms that \\nwere identified in the reviews. It also authorized APA staff assigned \\nto the guideline development panel to compile information on pos -\\nsible harms and burdens of interventions as well as patient values \\nand preferences from an additional search of the literature. Details \\nof the search process methodology for both of these supplemental \\nsources of information are described below. The findings of these \\nadditional reviews along with input from clinicians and consumers \\non the panel were used to make the treatment recommendations \\nmore comprehensive with regard to the risk of harm or adverse \\nevents associated with various interventions for depression (deter -\\nmined to be a critical outcome ) and patient values and preferences. \\nEach panel member received an explicit opportunity to raise \\nany questions or concerns about the process of completing each \\ndecision table or the grid. The panel as a group reviewed each decision table and grid to identify any questions or concerns that \\nusers of the guideline (including patients, clinicians, scientists, \\nand administrators) might raise.

For each recommendation, text description \\nand a justification for the recommendation were included on the \\ndecision table and grid (see Appendix C as well as additional appen -\\ndices links). \\nRating of aggregate/global strength of evidence.  For each of the \\ndecision tables and grids, aggregate/global strength of evidence  was \\nbased on the strength of evidence from the review for the two criti -\\ncal outcomes, namely, response to treatment (reduction in depres -\\nsive symptoms) and serious adverse events. The panel adopted the \\nGRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development \\nand Evaluation) consortium standard that the aggregate strength of \\nevidence could be no higher than the lowest individual strength of \\nevidence for each of the critical outcomes (Guyatt et al., 2013). For example, if one critical outcome had “high” strength of evidence \\nbut the other critical outcome had “low” strength of evidence, the \\nglobal quality of evidence for that particular decision table or col -\\numn in the grid would be low, because that is the lowest strength \\nof evidence for an individual critical outcome. The strength of evi -\\ndence for serious harms, one of the panel’s critical outcomes, was \\ninsufficient/very low, for all interventions for which decision tables \\nand grid columns were completed. This explains why the global \\nstrength of evidence was insufficient/very low for all interventions, \\ndespite low, moderate, or high strength of evidence for the critical \\noutcome of response to treatment. \\nAssessing magnitude of benefits . One of the key components of \\nthe decision-making process for the guideline developmental panel \\nwas assessment of the balance between benefits and harms. This \\nrequired the quantification of both benefits and harms. \\nQuantification of benefits was based on data from the quan -\\ntitative meta-analyses for each of the important and critical out -\\ncomes that the panel had selected at the start of the guideline \\ndevelopment panel process for those interventions that had at \\nleast low quality of evidence for the critical outcome, response to \\ntreatment. For each of the outcomes on the decision tables, mag -\\nnitude of benefits and harms/burdens was rated on a five-point \\nscale: (1) large/modest\\n48 benefit; (2) small benefit; (3) no effect; \\n(4) small harm; and (5) modest49/large harm.50 On the grids, the \\npanel rated the magnitude of benefits as large, modest,51 or small \\nbenefit of Treatment 1 relative to Treatment 2 and the reverse or \\nNo difference in effect or Unable to rate. The same was done for \\nharms/burdens. \\nAssessing magnitude of harm/burdens.  Because “serious \\nadverse events” was one of the two critical outcomes of treatment \\n48 Ho wever, the panel later decided that it preferred the term “moderate” instead of “modest.”\\n49 Same as f ootnote #48.\\n50 T he following served as an approximate rule of thumb: a small effect size is 0.20, medium is 0.50 and large is 0.90.\\n51 Same as f ootnote #48.decided on by the panel, these needed more precise specification \\nand definition. Ultimately, panel members considered events such as the need for hospitalization secondary to suicidality as a seri -\\nous adverse event and then identified additional harms such as \\nmedication side effects. Harms were differentiated from burdens \\nthat were identified as disruptions associated with treatment (i.e., time spent, homework/need to practice, cost, convenience) rath -\\ner than as injury. As discussed earlier, the review of the treatment'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='er than as injury. As discussed earlier, the review of the treatment \\nliterature did not generate sufficient data on harms and burdens \\nof interventions because, unfortunately, this information is not \\nroutinely reported in studies of psychosocial interventions and \\nnot reported in detail in many studies of psychopharmacologi -\\ncal interventions. In light of this deficit, the APA Task Force to \\nRevise the Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) for quanti -\\ntative research included in the new standards the suggestion that \\nrandomized controlled trial researchers report data regarding \\nharms and burdens including indicating “none” if there were none \\n(Appelbaum et al., 2018).\\nIn response to this deficit, the panel requested that APA \\nstaff examine each article in the reviews to extract data regarding \\nharms and burdens, such as dropout/attrition, symptom wors -\\nening, homework, etc. For the older adult review, the same data \\nextraction was also conducted on those studies identified but excluded from the systematic review because of high risk of bias \\nto expand the available pool of information. In addition, a focused \\nliterature search of the PsycINFO\\n® database was conducted for \\nolder adults. Some of the search terms used included: “depression,” \\n“treatment,” and “older adults.” Recognizing time constraints and \\nexpecting only limited incremental additional evidence, the adult \\nand child/adolescent data on harms and burdens was derived from \\nonly an examination of the articles included within the reviews and \\nnot additional searches or examination of any excluded articles. It \\nwas from these studies that the panel had additional information on \\npossible harms or burdens associated with the interventions under \\nconsideration. Further, as described in more detail below, physician \\nmembers of the panel provided information on potential harms/\\nburdens of medications. Moreover, panel members consulted with \\na prominent expert in child psychiatry regarding the panel’s rec -\\nommendations pertaining to medication in children/adolescents to \\nreview and assess for any potential concerns. \\nThe panel also addressed the issue of attrition as a possible \\nharm. Because attrition in a randomized trial can signify different \\nthings (e.g., stopping because treatment is not acceptable or tol -\\nerable versus discontinuing due to early symptom relief) the panel \\ndid not consider it to be a harm unless information regarding the \\nreasons for attrition were specified or unless there were differen -\\ntial attrition rates across treatment groups (Zandberg, Rosenfield, \\nAlpert, McLean, & Foa, 2016). \\nFinally, in order to supplement the limited information on \\nharms and burdens gleaned from published research, clinicians'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='36\\u2003APA \\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depressionon the panel reported their experiences in delivering, supervising, \\nor training in particular interventions and the concerns noted by colleagues. Consumer members reported on both their own and \\npeer experiences with various interventions. In general, many of \\nthe identified harms and burdens pertaining to psychosocial inter -\\nventions were more general and common to most psychosocial \\ntreatments, for example, the potential for short-term exacerba -\\ntion of symptoms (harm) or the time necessary for multiple psy -\\nchotherapy sessions (burden). Further, clinicians and consumer \\nmembers reported various side effects as potential harms of med -\\nication treatment. Though it was important to obtain all available \\nsources of information on patient values and preferences, due to \\nthe inclusion of both anecdotal (i.e., clinician and consumer report) \\nand peer-reviewed article information, the strength of evidence on \\nthese topics was rated as insufficient/very low.  \\nOnce possible harms and burdens were identified, panel \\nmembers then compared these with the benefits of the interven -\\ntions. On the decision table for each intervention, the panel rated \\nwhether the benefits “clearly outweigh” or “slightly outweigh” the \\nharms and burdens or the reverse. On the grids the panel rated \\nwhether the balance of benefits to harms/burdens strongly or \\nslightly favors Treatment 1 over Treatment 2 or the reverse, the bal -\\nance of benefits to harms/burdens was the same, or it was unable \\nto determine the balance of benefits to harms/burdens between \\nTreatment 1 and Treatment 2.\\nAssessing patient values and preferences.  In addition to assess -\\ning the benefits and the harms/burdens associated with specific interventions, the panel attempted to ascertain patient values and \\npreferences. As described above, in order to ascertain this infor -\\nmation, the panel relied on a search of the literature as well as cli -\\nnicians and consumers on the panel who voiced their perspectives \\nabout preferences for different interventions as well as the value \\nthat patients might place on different outcomes or harms/burdens \\nassociated with particular treatments. The strength of evidence \\n(SOE) for all this information was very low because it included \\nobservational studies and “expert” (i.e., panel member) opinion. \\nApplicability of evidence. The final determinant that panel \\nmembers considered, before making recommendations, was the \\napplicability (generalizability)  of the evidence to various popula -\\ntions and settings. To organize information on applicability, panel \\nmembers applied the PICOTS framework (referring to Populations, \\nInterventions, Comparators, Outcomes, Time and Settings; \\nSamson & Schoelles, 2012) to review specific information from \\nthe studies to determine if there were any concerns pertinent to \\napplicability pertaining to population, interventions, comparators, \\noutcomes, timing, or settings to be noted in each decision table or on the grid. \\nDecision-making regarding treatment recommendations.  On the \\nbasis of the ratings of these four factors (strength of evidence, bal -\\nance of benefits versus harms/burdens, patient values and prefer -\\nences, and applicability), the panel then made a decision regarding \\nits recommendation for a particular treatment or comparison of \\ntreatments. The options ranged from a strong (“the panel recom -\\nmends”) or conditional (“the panel suggests”) recommendation \\neither in support of or against a particular treatment based on \\nthe combination of these factors. The panel could also choose to decide that there was insufficient evidence to make a recommen -\\ndation about a particular treatment.

The panel originally \\ndrafted recommendation statements for the combined populations of children and adoles-\\ncents given that the underlying reviews on children and adolescents combined the age groups \\ntogether and it was not possible to review the data separately. However, on further consider -\\nation the panel decided to separate the recommendations for children and adolescents, not \\nonly for reasons of development but also due to underlying methodological reasons in the \\nincluded reviews. Specifically, the child and adolescent reviews (Cipriani et al., 2016; Zhou et \\nal., 2015) both included only a relatively small pool of studies that focused on children only \\nas opposed to a combined or adolescent population and the Zhou et al. (2015) review specif -\\nically noted less robust findings for children specific to CBT and IPT.  Thus, the panel retained \\nthe recommendation statements for adolescents only and then separately noted that evi -\\ndence was insufficient to be able to make specific recommendations for type of psychotherapy \\nor pharmacotherapy for children. \\nThe generalizability of the evidence reviewed and presented here has some important \\nlimitations, which must be noted at the outset. Very few of the studies included in the \\nreviews included a wide range of racially diverse youth and focused instead primarily on \\nsocioeconomically diverse White youth and lower socioeconomic status youth of color \\n(when they were included). This reflects both that relatively few studies met the inclusion \\ncriteria (thereby potentially excluding studies that included more diverse samples) and \\nthe limited diversity in treatment samples in the published literature in general. Therefore, these recommendations must be viewed as limited in applicability to a diverse community \\nof mental health consumers.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content='38\\u2003APA \\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of DepressionWith this caveat, the panel’s comprehensive review leads to \\nthe recommendation for the use of psychotherapy to treat adoles -\\ncent depression. The best evidence is for interpersonal psychother -\\napy (adapted for adolescents) and cognitive-behavioral therapy \\n(CBT), enabling a recommendation for both of these psychosocial \\ninterventions versus no treatment or waitlist, and versus treatment \\nas usual or psychological placebo conditions. The evidence base \\nfor behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, family therapy, play ther -\\napy, problem-solving therapy, and psychodynamic and supportive \\npsychotherapy is insufficient for recommendation of any of these \\ntreatments versus no treatment or waitlist, and versus treatment \\nas usual or psychological placebo conditions.  When the aforemen -\\ntioned treatments (CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy [adapted for \\nadolescents], behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, family therapy, \\nplay therapy, problem-solving therapy, psychodynamic and sup -\\nportive psychotherapy) were compared with each other, there was \\ninsufficient evidence for the panel to recommend for or against cli -\\nnicians offering any of the psychotherapies over any of the other \\npsychotherapies listed. CBT and IPT are two psychotherapies \\nwhich have multiple RCTs demonstrating their efficacy in decreas -\\ning depression symptoms in adolescents. The comparison condi -\\ntions in these studies include waitlist control group and supportive \\npsychotherapy/treatment as usual; however, they do not include \\nbehavior therapy, play therapy, problem-solving therapy, psycho -\\ndynamic psychotherapy, or manualized supportive psychotherapy. \\nThus, there is insufficient information regarding their comparative \\neffectiveness to a greater number of therapeutic approaches.\\nAddressing diverse child/adolescent populations. Interestingly, \\nIPT-A has an evidence base focused on a more racially diverse \\n(African American and Latino) sample of youth than CBT (Zhou et \\nal., 2015). However, studies of each of these therapies contain areas \\nof insufficient data and information to allow the panel to judge them \\nin more depth or to make more nuanced recommendations. \\nSpecifically, most of the studies on IPT-A did not include information \\non long-term outcomes of treated participants. Moreover, for many \\nof the studies of CBT reviewed by the panel, the CBT condition was compared with a waitlist condition rather than other active treat -\\nments. Thus, the effect sizes of the outcomes in the CBT arm might \\nbe overstated given evidence that waitlist control conditions show \\ngreater effect sizes in favor of the active treatment than no treatment \\nor usual treatment comparisons (Steinert, Stadter, Stark, & \\nLeichsenring, 2017). Despite these concerns, IPT-A and CBT still \\npresent the best evidence that the field has to date on positive out -\\ncomes for the treatment of depression in youth. \\nEfficacy of child/adolescent psychopharmacological interventions. \\nThe panel also reviewed the evidence for psychopharmacologic inter -\\nventions for depression in children and adolescents. In this regard, \\nwhile the panel found a review that met AMSTAR criteria (Cipriani et \\nal., 2016), many other reviews did not. The review included studies of \\nmedications that are not currently widely used in the treatment of \\nyouth depression due to safety concerns. So, while there is clear evi -\\ndence from multiple randomized controlled trials for the use of fluox -\\netine (Prozac) in children and adolescents, there is limited evidence \\nmeeting the IOM or AMSTAR criteria for other antidepressants, including the other Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved \\nantidepressant for youth, escitalopram (Lexapro). In this regard, we \\nnote that although the FDA approved the medication escitalopram, in \\nthe panel’s review of the evidence, we were unable to recommend for \\nor against this medication. Finally, although Nefazodone (Serzone)'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content='the panel’s review of the evidence, we were unable to recommend for \\nor against this medication. Finally, although Nefazodone (Serzone) \\nwas included in our review, the panel has elected not to provide rec -\\nommendation on the use of this medication as an antidepressant given \\nits lack of clinical relevance for current practice (i.e., expert psychiatrist indication that this medication is almost never used for child or ado -\\nlescent care due to significant side effects). Thus, the panel concludes \\nthat the strongest evidence for a pharmacologic treatment for adoles -\\ncent depression is for fluoxetine (Prozac). If fluoxetine is not a treat -\\nment option or is not acceptable, the panel recommends shared \\ndecision-making regarding medication options with a child psychia -\\ntrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/ guardians or \\nfamily members actively involved in their care. However, more research \\nis needed comparing the efficacy of active medications with diverse \\npopulations and in combination with psychotherapy.\\nGeneral Adult Population\\nThe panel found that various types of interventions are available for the \\ntreatment of depression in the general adult population. For the initial treatment of adult patients with depression, the panel recommends that \\nclinicians offer either psychotherapy or second-generation antidepres -\\nsants and use a shared decision-making approach to consider options. \\nComparative effectiveness studies indicated similar effects across differ -\\nent models of psychotherapy. Thus, the panel does not make a recom -\\nmendation for a specific therapy for initial treatment among the following models, presented in alphabetical order: behavioral therapy, cognitive \\nand cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, psycho -\\ndynamic therapy, and supportive therapy. If considering combined treat -\\nment, the panel recommends cognitive-behavioral therapy or \\ninterpersonal psychotherapy plus a second-generation antidepressant. \\nNote that there are some differences in how the panel chose to structure \\nrecommendations for children/ adolescents versus those for adults \\nbecause there was insufficient evidence for treatments other than CBT \\nand IPT-A in the adolescent literature, while evidence of no difference \\nbetween multiple treatments in the adult literature. The panel chose to \\nemphasize comparative effectiveness data in the adult literature.  \\nBeyond these recommendations the panel conditionally sug -\\ngests several treatments based on particular nuanced situations \\n(i.e., for an individual with depression who is also experiencing rela -\\ntionship distress; please refer to Table 3 for details based on specific \\nsituations) and notes several treatments for which there is insuf -\\nficient evidence to be able to make a recommendation. Regarding \\ncomplementary and alternative treatments, the panel gave no higher \\nthan a conditional recommendation for use. Specifically, the panel \\nsuggested starting with exercise and St. John’s Wort and then sug\\n-\\ngested several alternatives if these were not available or acceptable. \\nThe panel also noted a variety of complementary and alternative \\ntreatments for which the evidence is insufficient to be able to make \\na recommendation. However, the panel urges caution when using \\nover-the-counter agents to prevent unintended drug-drug interac -\\ntions particularly given variable manufacturing practices.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='APA\\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depression\\u2003 39Partial- or non-responders to initial antidepressant treatment and \\nrelapse prevention. The panel then considered partial or non-re -\\nsponders to initial antidepressant treatment and recommended that \\nthese individuals switch from antidepressant medication alone to \\ncognitive therapy alone or switch from antidepressant medication \\nalone to another antidepressant medication. The panel then made no \\nhigher than a conditional suggestion and noted several instances in \\nwhich there was insufficient information to make a recommendation \\nfor nuanced situations with this population. Finally, the panel consid -\\nered relapse prevention and made a conditional suggestion that cli -\\nnicians offer psychotherapy rather than antidepressant medication \\nor treatment as usual to prevent relapse.  \\nOverall, the effect sizes of these therapies are comparable and \\ndirect comparisons among therapies do not indicate major differ -\\nences between the therapies. There were many instances in which \\nthe panel determined there was insufficient evidence to be able to \\ndetermine whether there was a difference in effect between two \\npotential treatment options. The panel encourages shared deci -\\nsion-making with the patient.\\nSubgroup effects. Unfortunately, there are no clear indications \\nregarding which patient with which characteristics will benefit from \\nwhich treatment, although there has been some recent work devel -\\noping algorithms that are promising (Cohen & DeRubeis, 2018; \\nDeRubeis et al., 2014). It is therefore up to the therapist to discuss \\nwith each patient which treatment he or she prefers, with consider -\\nation of expected outcomes, side effects, possible negative effects, \\ncosts, and time investment of patients. The majority of patients \\nprefer psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy (McHugh, Whitton, \\nPeckham, Welge, & Otto, 2013), although an important minority \\n(about 25%) prefer pharmacotherapy. Patient preferences for spe -\\ncific psychotherapies were not available in the reviewed systematic \\nreviews/meta-analyses. \\nIn addition, combined treatments of psychotherapy and phar -\\nmacotherapy are more effective than either of the treatments \\nalone in some subpopulations, but the costs, risk of side effects, \\nand demands on patients are greater. In addition, some research \\nsuggests combined treatment may interfere with enduring effects \\nfor psychotherapy (Hollon et al., 2014). As such it is up to the pro -\\nvider and patient to decide whether a combined treatment is pref -\\nerable. For patients with chronic and treatment-resistant depres -\\nsion, combined treatment is usually recommended (Cuijpers et al., \\n2010; Jobst et al., 2016). \\nDelivery of treatments. Although the recommendations focus on \\ntypes of interventions, the way in which treatments are delivered is \\nalso important. However, the current review provided limited infor -\\nmation in this area. For example, collaborative care approaches have \\nbeen well established, and a considerable number of trials have \\nshown that collaborative care is an evidence-based and well-estab -\\nlished system for delivering treatments of depression. The collabora -\\ntive care model for depression involves depression care managers \\nwith special training in evidence-based interventions and regular \\nmental health specialty consultation and can provide efficacious care \\nfor primary care patients across the life span—adolescents, young, \\nmiddle-aged, and older adults (IMPACT; Unützer et al., 2002; Richardson, McCarty, Radovic, & Suleiman, 2017). However, the \\ncurrent review did not address this or other considerations of treat -\\nment delivery.\\nThe panel found insufficient evidence about the effec -\\ntiveness of psychotherapies in specific target groups, such as \\nstudents, and people with general medical conditions, such as \\ndiabetes, heart disease, and cancer. There was also very limit -\\ned data on which to determine whether treatment format (e.g.,'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='students, and people with general medical conditions, such as \\ndiabetes, heart disease, and cancer. There was also very limit -\\ned data on which to determine whether treatment format (e.g., \\nindividual, group, phone-based, computer delivered, bibliothera -\\npy, etc.) influenced efficacy. What little evidence was available regarding format was primarily for CBT and did not find differenc -\\nes. However, the limitations of the literature reflect the need for \\nmore research comparing modalities.\\nOverall, treatments for depression have a modest impact on \\nalleviating symptoms of depression (with numbers-needed-to-\\ntreat of about six to eight [meaning about six to eight need to be treated for each one that is successfully treated]). This reflects \\nboth the high rate of spontaneous recovery, placebo effects of \\ntreatment, and the modest effect of treatment (either psychother -\\napy or pharmacotherapy). It should also be noted that there is an \\nimportant group of patients who do not recover, neither through \\nspontaneous recovery nor treatments. \\nEnduring effects of treatment. Overall psychotherapies seem to \\nhave longer term effects that can be seen 6 to 12 months after treat -\\nment ends, while the relapse rates after discontinuation of antide-pressants are very high, and direct comparisons between psychotherapies and antidepressants suggest that the effects of psychotherapies may be better in the longer term (Cuijpers et al., \\n2013; Karyotaki, Smit, de Beurs, et al., 2016; Karyotaki, Smit, \\nHenningsen, et al., 2016). There is clear evidence that CBT has an \\nenduring effect, and other types of psychotherapies may as well, that \\nis not found for antidepressant medications (Cuijpers, 2013). The \\nenduring effect is large (odds ratio greater than two), and it is robust \\n(six out of eight studies reviewed by Cuijpers with a seventh just \\nunder two) and it is at least as large in magnitude as keeping patients \\non continuation antidepressant medication. Behavioral activation \\nalso showed a similar effect in the one study in which it was tested \\n(Dobson et al., 2008) and long-term dynamic psychotherapy relative \\nto treatment as usual (which could include antidepressant medica-tion) may have a similar effect as well (Fonagy, 2015). Further, the \\npossibility remains that any psychosocial intervention that teaches \\nskills or changes underlying diatheses will have an enduring effect \\nthat would not be expected for antidepressant. The possibility of \\nenduring effects of different treatments is a topic that may be dis -\\ncussed between clinicians and patients as part of shared deci -\\nsion-making about treatment. \\nOlder Adults\\nThe panel’s recommendations and suggestions for CBT, prob -\\nlem-solving therapy, and life-review therapy rather than no treatment \\nor treatment as usual are largely consistent with other reviews of older adult depression treatment research (Cuijpers, Karyotaki, Pot, \\net al., 2014a; Wilkinson & Izmeth, 2012). These treatments included'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='40\\u2003APA \\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depressionmodifications that made them more appropriate for use with older \\nadults, as noted in the APA (2014) Guidelines for Psychological Practice \\nwith Older Adults . When considering initial treatment of major \\ndepressive disorder in older adults, the panel recommends either \\ngroup life-review treatment or group CBT (either alone or added to \\nusual care) over no treatment or combined pharmacotherapy and \\ninterpersonal psychotherapy over interpersonal psychotherapy \\nalone. If these options are not available or acceptable the panel then \\nconditionally suggests particular treatments based on nuanced situ -\\nations and also notes situations in which the evidence is insufficient \\nto be able to make a recommendation. \\nFor subthreshold/minor depression the panel conditionally \\nsuggests CBT, life-review treatment, and problem-solving ther -\\napy and notes situations in which there is not sufficient evidence \\nto make a recommendation. For situations in which there is major \\ndepressive disorder or minor depression and cognitive impairment, \\nthe panel suggests problem-solving therapy but notes insufficient \\nevidence to make a recommendation about the combination of \\nbehavioral activation and treatment as usual. \\nFor persistent depressive disorder, the panel conditionally sug -\\ngests problem-solving therapy (individual) or paroxetine though \\nnotes that some argue that paroxetine is contraindicated in older \\nadults due to its anticholinergic side effects (see the American \\nGeriatrics Society 2015 Beers Criteria) and many geriatric psychi -\\natrists would prefer another SSRI (i.e., escitalopram or sertraline). \\nWhen an older adult presents with both major depressive disorder \\nand medical or other complications, the panel makes several condi -\\ntional suggestions based on the particular nuanced situation. \\nRelapse prevention in older adults. Finally, for prevention of recur -\\nrence the panel recommends combination interpersonal psychother -\\napy and pharmacotherapy or combination supportive care and \\npharmacotherapy. If those options are not available, the panel con -\\nditionally suggests interpersonal psychotherapy for prevention of \\nrecurrence. The panel notes that the evidence is insufficient to be \\nable to recommend between cognitive-behavioral therapy (group) \\nplus pharmacotherapy and pharmacotherapy alone for preventing \\nrecurrence.\\n Relation to other literature. In another effort, Scogin and colleagues \\n(2005), using Society of Clinical Psychology criteria (a less rigorous \\ncriteria than that of the IOM for guideline development), also found \\nCBT, problem-solving therapy, and life-review to be beneficial but in \\naddition found behavior therapy, brief psychodynamic therapy, and \\ncognitive bibliotherapy to be evidence-based therapies. Studies of \\nthese latter interventions did not meet criteria for inclusion in current \\nsystematic reviews due to lack of some methodological features to \\nreduce bias and improve the quality (typical of studies of psycholog -\\nical treatments conducted prior to 2000). Similarly, interpersonal \\npsychotherapy has been identified by some as an effective treatment \\nfor older adults (Hinrichsen, 2009).\\nThe panel’s recommendations and suggestions that psycho -\\nlogical treatments be provided across the severity spectrum (i.e., \\nmajor depressive disorder, subthreshold) is important because \\nsubsyndromal or minor depressive symptom presentations are fre -\\nquently occurring among older adults. Pharmacotherapy is usually not indicated for subsyndromal depressive symptom cases and \\nthus there is a particular need for psychological treatments and \\nCBT, problem-solving therapy, life-review and possibly other inter -\\nventions can be recommended. It is also worth noting that older \\nadults and younger adults appear to demonstrate similar improve -\\nments in response to psychotherapy (Cuijpers et al, 2009).\\nOlder adults’ treatment preference and treatment considerations.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='adults and younger adults appear to demonstrate similar improve -\\nments in response to psychotherapy (Cuijpers et al, 2009).\\nOlder adults’ treatment preference and treatment considerations. \\nBecause older adults often express a preference for psychological \\ntreatments and provision of such service in primary healthcare set -\\ntings, it is important that efforts to integrate the two continue. \\nHowever, specialists in delivering late-life depression treatment, \\nparticularly in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and social work, \\nare scarce and thus create a conundrum for delivering efficacious \\ninterventions identified by this panel. Integrated care is one such \\nmodel that may address the underuse of depression treatment ser -\\nvices by older adults (Bruce et al., 2004; Unützer et al., 2002). In \\naddition, given that older adults are more likely to have other health \\nconditions, psychotherapy remains a preferred treatment as medica -\\ntions have potential for adverse interactions with other medications. \\nIntegrated care can help address both mental and physical health \\nproblems and ensure more seamless treatment (Reiter, Dobmeyer, & \\nHunter, 2018). Finally, regarding the medication recommendations it \\nshould be noted that while nortriptyline was used in the past due to \\nits efficacy and safety, practices have changed significantly, and \\nnortriptyline is now viewed as a second- or third-line pharmacother -\\napy strategy for major depression. It is generally reserved for patients \\nwho have not done well with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor \\nor a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which are generally considered to be safer for older adults than nortriptyline.

According to the \\nAmerican Psychological Association’s Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct \\n(2017a), psychologists should obtain an informed consent from the patient prior to imple -\\nmenting psychological services. An informed consent is where psychologists (or other psy -\\nchotherapy clinician) “inform clients/patients as early as is feasible in the therapeutic \\nrelationship about the nature and anticipated course of therapy, fees, involvement of third \\nparties, and limits of confidentiality and provide sufficient opportunity for the client/patient \\nto ask questions and receive answers” (APA, 2017a, p. 14). \\nThe informed consent process is not only evident in psychotherapy but in other med -\\nical fields as well and it ensures that the patients’ rights are respected throughout treat -\\nment. For example, the American Medical Association’s Code of Ethics also mandates that \\nphysicians provide informed consent to patients (American Medical Association, 2016). \\nAfter assessing for the patient’s ability to make decisions this code notes that informed \\nconsent should include information about any known diagnosis; why particular interven -\\ntions are recommended and what is involved in these interventions; and benefits, harms, \\nand burdens of possible interventions including those for choosing to receive no treatment \\n(American Medical Association, 2016). The informed consent process allows the patient \\nto make an informed decision of whether to initiate or continue treatment, and it also sat -\\nisfies the General Principles of Beneficence and Nonmaleficence common across ethics \\ncodes in which clinicians “take care to do no harm” (American Psychological Association, \\n2017a, p. 3). When working with children and adolescents, the provider should convey this \\nsame information to the parent/guardian who must provide consent for treatment along \\nwith conveying this information to adolescents who must assent to treatment. For children, \\nit also would be helpful to convey some of the information regarding interventions to be \\nprovided and the rationale in an age-appropriate manner (American Academy of Child and \\nAdolescent Psychiatry, 2017).\\nIncorporation of research not included in the current guidelines.  The panel recognizes that \\nthere is literature that is relevant to decision-making about treatments that has not been \\nincorporated in this guideline.

These factors include demographic \\ncharacteristics, SES, preferences, values, personality traits, con -\\nversational styles, treatment history, trauma history, coping mech -\\nanisms, support networks, life circumstances, and resource avail -\\nability (time, money, and energy), as well as the real and perceived \\ncommonalities and differences between patient and provider.\\nUltimately, each of these factors along with the intended or \\nunintended effects of the intervention a clinician provides can play \\na significant role, dramatically influencing the patient’s progress. \\nDepending on the individual, any one factor may “tip the scale,” \\nhelping or hurting a patient’s resolve. In effect, any one of these \\nfactors can result in treatment adherence or nonadherence and \\nthus in the success or failure of the individual’s recovery. When the \\nindividual fails to recover, chronic illness, treatment recidivism, and \\nburdening of the crisis intervention systems can result. \\nWhen considering treatment compatibility, clinicians could \\nbenefit their patients by recognizing these many complex fac -\\ntors, while using empirically guided judgment and remembering \\nthat seeking treatment is itself a large hurdle for the majority of \\nindividuals. The challenge to find adequate care, acceptance of \\ndiversity, cultural competence, then compounded by the difficulty \\nand exhaustion of the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional work of \\ntherapy, strongly necessitates the need for a beneficial therapeutic \\nalliance and treatment engagement. \\nFurther, it also means that a disconnect between patient and \\nprovider (e.g., any discord between the patient’s ideal clinician \\nand the clinician received, or ideal services and the services ren -\\ndered [i.e., lapses in communication, discrepancies in treatment \\ngoals, momentary discomfort or perceptions of “awkwardness” \\nfor the patient]) can disrupt the therapeutic alliance (i.e., alliance \\nrupture; Muran & Barber, 2010) and the individual’s commitment \\nto treatment.

This refers to the notion of treatment fidelity or integrity. \\nIncluding protocols to evaluate treatment fidelity within a given \\nclinical trial makes it easier to assess whether the treatment under evaluation was actually delivered in the manner intended and pre -\\nscribed (Nezu & Nezu, 2008).  However, within “real-world” con -\\ntexts, it is likely that various exigencies arise such that complete \\nadherence to a treatment protocol becomes difficult. Once again, \\ntreatment providers must rely on their sound clinical judgment to \\nknow when to “deviate” from the protocol or cease a given treatment \\nif it is not “working.” \\nApplicability of results and clinical significance. The present clini-\\ncal practice guideline was developed to provide advice and guid -\\nance to various stakeholders (e.g., practitioners, patients) based on \\nvalid scientific evidence obtained within recent years. Whereas \\nscrutiny of the extant scientific literature to inform such guidelines \\nis critical and considered to be the “gold standard” methodology, \\nthe applicability of even an exhaustive and comprehensive review \\nand its subsequent conclusions is also dependent on various con -\\ntextual factors as noted. As such, when reading the recommenda -\\ntions, the reader should also consider the ability to generalize from \\naggregate data to the individual. \\nAbility to generalize from aggregate data to the individual. All \\nresearch data that were included as evidence (or lack) of the efficacy \\nof a given approach to treat depression is based on group data. In fact, \\na hallmark of sound outcome research involves including a sufficient \\nnumber of participants in the study such that meaningful statistical \\nanalyses can be conducted. This is referred to as power, or the ability \\nof a given study to validly detect a result that truly exists in nature. \\nHowever, such results can only provide general types of information. \\nThe more that the sample population of a given investigation deviates \\nfrom various characteristics of a given patient, the more informed \\nclinical judgment is necessary to validly identify a particular treat -\\nment approach for that individual.

The American Psychological Association’s (2017b) \\nMulticultural Guidelines: An Ecological Approach to Context, Identity, \\nand Intersectionality encourage the provision of multiculturally com -\\npetent services. Broadly, this multicultural competence includes \\n“appreciation for, understanding of, and willingness to learn about the \\nmulticultural backgrounds of individuals, families, couples, groups, \\nresearch participants, organizations, and communities” (American \\nPsychological Association, 2017b, pp. 7-8). Multicultural refers to a \\nrange of factors including culture, immigration status, race, language, \\nethnicity, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability status, reli -\\ngion, socioeconomic status, employment, education, spirituality, and \\nothers (APA, 2002; as cited in APA, 2017). Clinicians are also encour -\\naged to refer to the APA’s (2015) Guidelines for Psychological Practice \\nwith Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People and APA’s (2012) \\nGuidelines for Psychological Practice with Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual \\nClients, as this population experiences increased mental health con -\\ncerns. Providers are encouraged to provide multiculturally competent \\nservices in the context of the current depression guideline recom -\\nmendations.\\nExistence of a behavioral health or medical disorder comorbidity.  \\nAs noted earlier, depression is frequently found to be comorbid with \\nother mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, posttraumatic stress \\ndisorder), as well as in combination with various medical problems \\n(e.g., heart disease, cancer, stroke). Comorbidity was not directly \\nreviewed and is not reflected in the recommendations. However, \\ngiven the ubiquity of comorbidity, all stakeholders need to take this \\nlimitation into consideration when reviewing the present guideline \\nrecommendations.\\nGeneralizability of Treatments to Different \\nSettings and Providers\\nAbility to generalize from a given setting—patient perspective.  An \\naspect of professional competence involves the ability to accurately \\ngeneralize to a given setting and set of circumstances. Scientifically \\nsound research studies generally require that providers are experi -\\nenced and trained in the given approach under evaluation. This may \\ndiffer from typical usual care depending on the setting or place that \\na treatment is provided. Patients seeking a particular treatment may \\nwish to ask questions, not only about a given treatment, but the \\nextent to which those providing the treatment have been well trained. \\nWithin this context, prospective patients seeking treatment for depression should ask related questions to be assured that the treat -\\nment they believe they will be receiving will be provided in a quality \\nfashion. This care would ideally be provided by a qualified mental \\nhealth specialist though the panel acknowledges that accessibility to \\nthese specialists can be a barrier to treatment. Similarly, behavioral \\nhealth professionals seeking to provide those treatments recom -\\nmended in these guidelines need to receive adequate training and \\nexperience in the specific treatment approaches prior to offering \\nsuch services.\\nAbility to generalize from a given setting—provider perspective.  \\nJust as prospective recipients of psychotherapy should consider the \\nabove issues, so should treatment providers (including administra -\\ntors) consider similar issues. For example, the efficacy of a given \\napproach as found in a research study may only reflect its efficacy'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 47}, page_content='tors) consider similar issues. For example, the efficacy of a given \\napproach as found in a research study may only reflect its efficacy \\nbased on the specific treatment circumstances. For example, circum -\\nstances might include a treatment being delivered in an outpatient \\nrather than an inpatient setting or whether there were any additional resources made available to study participants that are unavailable \\nto patient’s in the provider’s treatment setting (e.g., monetary incen -\\ntive to minimize attrition, providing treatments for free). Such cir -\\ncumstances may limit the generalizability of treatment efficacy to \\nreal-world contexts.\\nWhen providers are confronted with implementing treatment \\nin settings that may be atypical from the “standard” outpatient \\npsychotherapy or pharmacotherapy structure often included in research studies, an option for individualizing the treatment might \\ninclude an emphasis on a collaborative model where patients  \\nbecome more active participants in the treatment process. For \\nexample, certain general medical settings have adopted a collabo -\\nrative care model whereby patients are provided an initial choice of psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy and depending on one’s prog -\\nress, predetermined algorithms help to determine further treat -\\nment choices (e.g., Unützer et al., 2002; depression with comor -\\nbid medical disease—Katon et al., 2010). Such protocols require \\ninvolvement of various health care specialists to work together to improve a patient’s depression and overall heath quality of life and \\nrequire additional resources beyond typical outpatient services. \\nAltogether, administrators and therapists need to consider the rel -\\nevance of the literature to their specific treatment setting/context, options for addressing such gaps in literature when making treat -\\nment choices, and the applicability of the collaborative care model \\nfor their specific treatment setting or context.\\nMonitoring Engagement with Treatment \\nIn a related manner, in order to better assess whether a treatment \\nworks involves determining the recipient’s (i.e., patient’s) actual \\ncomprehension or application of any suggestions or directions “pre -\\nscribed” by the therapist. From a pharmacotherapy perspective, this \\ninvolves identifying whether the patient followed directions regard-ing medication (e.g., taking the prescribed pills at the appropriate \\ntime). In other words, if one is uncertain whether a person actually \\ningested the medication, it becomes difficult to conclude whether \\nany improvement (or lack of) in symptoms occurred because of the'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 48}, page_content='APA\\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depression\\u2003 45medication. For directive psychotherapy approaches, this might \\ninvolve evaluating whether the patient completed a homework \\nassignment, practiced a certain skill, or read a prescribed book. For \\nnondirective approaches, this may be difficult as there may be no \\ninstructions or guidance given; however, certain subtle indicators of \\npatient comprehension or application may include a patient’s \\nincreased curiosity, awareness, or insight into his/her experiences. \\nThe panel highlights these treatment integrity concerns to under -\\nscore their importance regarding the quality of a given research study \\n(Sharpless & Barber, 2009) and implications for recommendations.\\nContributions from Shared and Specific Factors \\nto Treatment Outcome\\nFuture research is needed to address the lack of adequate research \\nexamining the effective components of psychotherapy, or studies \\nexamining psychotherapeutic process, in the available reviews. This, \\nin part, reflects the IOM’s emphasis on quality of research for deter -\\nmination of efficacy of interventions, resulting in a focus on random -\\nized controlled trials. While there is significant discussion of the \\nrelative importance of shared versus model-specific aspects of psy -\\nchotherapy, there is not adequate research examining this question \\nthat sufficiently reduces potential risks of bias and other issues in a \\nmanner that could inform treatment recommendations. However, \\nthere is research suggesting that this may be a promising area for \\nfuture studies. For example, a study by Cuijpers, Reynolds, et al. \\n(2012b) examined the contributions of nonspecific, extra-therapeu -\\ntic, and specific factors to patients’ improvement. Results indicated that nonspecific factors accounted for 49.6% of the improvement, \\nwhereas extra-therapeutic factors accounted for 33.3% and specific \\nfactors accounted for 17.1% of the improvement (Cuijpers, Reynolds, \\net al., 2012b). This correlational study suggests an important role for \\nnonspecific factors in treatment.

Change processes can be \\ndefined in terms of: (1) change principles, which refer to conditions or characteristics (e.g., \\nparticipant, relationship, and treatment components) that have been shown to predict treat -\\nment outcome (see APA Presidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice, 2006; \\nCastonguay & Beutler, 2006; see also Goldfried, 1980); (2) change mechanisms, which refer \\nto factors that lead to therapeutic change as demonstrated by mediational or related analyses \\n(Kazdin, 2007; Laurenceau, Hayes, & Feldman, 2007; Lorenzo-Luaces, German, & DeRubeis, \\n2015); and (3) change events, which refer to in-session interactions between patients and \\ntherapists that are linked to overall treatment outcomes (Greenberg, 1986).\\nIt is important to note that this brief discussion of change processes is descriptive and \\nis not based on a systematic review. Rather, the panel is highlighting a few examples of com -\\nmonly cited change processes because of the value gained by understanding some of the \\nways that recommended treatments exert their beneficial effects. The panel is not making \\nany formal recommendations in this section, and this is not a comprehensive list of all the \\nchange processes in the treatment of depression.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 50}, page_content='APA\\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depression\\u2003 47Change Principles \\nCastonguay and Beutler (2006) reviewed numerous change princi -\\nples that have been shown in empirical studies to play a role in the \\ntreatment of depression (see Beutler, Castonguay, & Follette, 2006, \\nfor an integration of these findings). Examples include:\\nParticipant. Patient expectations; readiness to change; and attach -\\nment, coping, and personality styles (Beutler et al., 2006; see also \\nBernecker, 2012).\\nTechnical. Cognitive reappraisals, trying new behaviors, altering \\nbehavioral reinforcements, improving interpersonal and social func -\\ntioning, promoting emotion processing and regulation, and conduct -\\ning a structured therapy session (Follette & Greenberg, 2006; see \\nalso Auszra, Greenberg, & Hermann, 2013; Missirlian, Toukmanian, \\nWarwar, & Greenberg, 2005; Pos, Greenberg, Goldman, & Korman, \\n2003; Whelton, 2004).\\nRelationship. Research on psychotherapy per se has underscored \\nthe association between having a positive therapeutic relationship or \\nalliance, that is, the means by which a therapist and a patient hope \\nto engage with each other, and positive change (Cuijpers, Driessen, \\net al., 2012a). Norcross (2011) presents a number of meta-analyses \\nthat examined the effect of elements of the therapeutic relationship \\non treatment outcome. An interdisciplinary task force concluded that \\nevidence supported a demonstrable effect of the alliance and empathy, \\nthe probable effect of consensus and positive regard, and the promis-\\ning effect of rupture repair and management of the therapist emo -\\ntional reactions (Norcross & Wampold, 2011). The implication of \\nsuch consensus is that in addition to a given treatment approach for \\ndepression, people seeking treatment need to also consider the rela -\\ntionship one has with the potential provider as it has been shown to \\nbe correlated with treatment outcome. Similarly, providers should \\nattempt to offer evidenced-based treatment within the context of a \\npositive therapeutic alliance.\\nChange Mechanisms\\nLemmens, Müller, Arntz, and Huibers (2016) conducted a system -\\natic review of 35 studies aimed at identifying mediators in various \\nforms of psychotherapy for depression. They found that change in \\ndysfunctional attitudes, negative “automatic” thoughts, mindfulness \\nand worry skills, and rumination mediated change in outcomes (e.g., \\ndepression symptoms) in most studies, and they found mixed evi -\\ndence supporting mediational roles for attributional style, behavioral \\ncomponents, and therapeutic alliance.  \\nA review by Lorenzo-Luaces et al. (2015) reported some evi -\\ndence that cognitive change (including both ability to use skills to \\nmodify cognitions and changes in cognitions, such as automatic \\nthoughts and beliefs) mediates symptom change in cognitive ther -\\napy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for depression, as \\npredicted by the theoretical models underpinning those therapies. \\nA review by van der Velden et al. (2015) reported that changes in mindfulness, rumination, worry, compassion, or meta-awareness mediated effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for depres -\\nsion. In addition, S. Cohen, O’Leary, Foran, and Kliem (2014) report -\\ned that among women who received brief couple therapy for depres -\\nsion, changes in depressive symptoms were mediated by changes \\nin their own illness-related cognitions and behaviors, and in their \\nperceptions of increased positivity and support from their husbands. \\nThere is also some evidence that skills learning and practice during \\nhomework assignments contribute to better outcomes for cogni -\\ntive, behavioral, and cognitive-behavioral therapies for depression \\n(Kazantzis, Whittington, & Dattilio, 2010; Terides et al., 2017).\\nResearch on change mechanisms in psychodynamic psycho -\\ntherapies (some focused on depression) has provided varying sup -\\nport for the following variables facilitating better outcomes: greater'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 50}, page_content='Research on change mechanisms in psychodynamic psycho -\\ntherapies (some focused on depression) has provided varying sup -\\nport for the following variables facilitating better outcomes: greater \\ninsight, change in defensive style (more mature), less relationship \\nrigidity and maladaptive representations, higher object relations, \\ngreater reflective functioning, and better therapeutic alliances \\n(see Barber, Muran, McCarthy & Keefe, 2013, for a review; see \\nalso Minges, Solomonov, & Barber, 2017; Zilcha-Mano, Chiu, et al., \\n2016a; & Zilcha-Mano, Muran, et al., 2016b).

For severe depression, anti -\\ndepressant medication is also recommended alone until the child \\ncan begin psychotherapy or in combination with psychotherapy \\nfrom the start. A combination of antidepressant medication and \\npsychotherapy was recommended for children that do not respond \\nto monotherapy of either medication or psychotherapy. \\nThe American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry’s \\nguideline recommendation for interpersonal psychotherapy or \\nCBT is similar to the American Psychological Association guide -\\nline’s recommendation for interpersonal psychotherapy (adapted \\nfor adolescents) or CBT treatment. The American Academy of \\nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry guideline also cautiously recom -\\nmends certain antidepressant medications (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and suggests combination of treatment may \\nbe warranted with more severe clinical presentations. The APA \\nguideline recommendations, however, do not address combi -\\nnation treatment of psychotherapy and antidepressant medica -\\ntion for children/adolescents. However, it should be noted that the Treatment of Adolescent Depression (TADS) study is the \\nlargest study to date examining adolescents with persistent and \\nimpairing major depression. This study compared CBT as a stand-\\nalone intervention to antidepressant medication (fluoxetine), the \\ncombination of CBT and medication, and a placebo sugar pill \\nacross 13 sites and included over 400 adolescents (March et al., \\n2004). The study concluded that combination treatment of flu -\\noxetine and CBT resulted in significantly better outcomes than \\nCBT or fluoxetine alone (March et al., 2004). A more recent evi -\\ndence-based update examined psychosocial interventions for the \\ntreatment of child and adolescent depression (Weersing, Jeffreys, \\nDo, Schwartz, & Bolano, 2016). This study concluded that both \\nCBT and interpersonal psychotherapy are well-established inter -\\nventions (though they have limited evidence for racially diverse \\nyouth), with evidence of efficacy in multiple trials by independent \\ninvestigative teams. However, the conclusion is tempered by \\nthe smaller number of studies for interpersonal psychotherapy \\nadapted for adolescents (IPT-A) and the concern that the effects \\nof CBT may be diminished when applied to populations with more comorbidity and diversity of ethnicity and socioeconomic sta -\\ntus, and when compared to active treatments (Weersing et al., \\n2016). While informative, the panel did not find these studies to \\nyet warrant recommendations regarding combined treatment for children and adolescents and desires more comparative effec -\\ntiveness and combined treatment research. \\nThe guideline for treating depression in adults from the Kaiser \\nPermanente Care Management Institute (2012) recommends \\neither antidepressant medication or psychotherapy (cognitive-be -\\nhavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, or problem-solv -'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 52}, page_content='Permanente Care Management Institute (2012) recommends \\neither antidepressant medication or psychotherapy (cognitive-be -\\nhavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, or problem-solv -\\ning therapy) as first line treatments for patients whose major \\ndepressive disorder is mild to moderate, with consideration given \\nto patient and clinician preferences, medication side effects, and \\ncost. A combination of antidepressant medication and psychother -\\napy (cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, or \\nproblem-solving therapy) is recommended for patients with chron -\\nic or severe major depressive disorder. According to that guideline, \\nthe following medication classes can be used as first line treat -\\nment: tricyclics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), sero -\\ntonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), norepinephrine \\nreuptake inhibitor (NRI), or dopamine agonist, based on patient \\nand clinician preferences, medication side effects, and cost. The \\nKaiser guideline does not recommend for or against St. John’s Wort \\n(hypericum) for mild to moderate major depressive disorder but \\nrecommends against St. John’s Wort for severe major depressive \\ndisorder.

Both the APA and \\nKaiser guidelines recommend consideration of patient culture, val -\\nues and preferences, and medication side effects.

For example, in some \\ninstances the Veteran’s Affairs/Department of Defense guideline \\nrecommends a particular intervention for which the APA guideline \\ndoes not due to insufficient evidence or other factors. It should be \\nnoted that the APA guideline deemed evidence to be insufficient \\nfor drafting a recommendation if all the outcomes for that particu -\\nlar intervention were classified as having very low/insufficient evi -\\ndence and only drafted recommendations for those interventions \\nincluded in the review in which at least one outcome was of low \\nor higher quality evidence. Moreover, following best practices, the \\nAPA panel only used data from a systematic review included in the \\nVeteran’s Affairs/Department of Defense review if it was consid -\\nered current from the past 5 years (dating no farther back than \\n2012). Thus, the reader will note some differences in conclusions \\ndrawn from the same data review between the guidelines. \\nThe guideline from the National Institute for Health and Care \\nExcellence (NICE) focuses on children and adolescents ages 5–18 \\nyears old.

For mild depression and per -\\nsistent depressive disorder, the guideline recommends watchful \\nwaiting for up to 4 weeks, nondirective supportive therapy, group \\ncognitive-behavioral therapy, or guided self-help. The NICE guide -\\nline recommends against using antidepressant medication as an \\ninitial treatment for mild depression in children and adolescents.  \\nFor moderate to severe depression, the guideline recommends \\nbrief psychological therapy (individual CBT, interpersonal psycho -\\ntherapy, family therapy, or psychodynamic psychotherapy) with or \\nwithout fluoxetine. \\nFor depression that is recurrent, unresponsive to treatment, or \\npsychotic, the NICE guideline recommends intensive psychological \\ntherapy of an alternative therapy than what was already tried (indi -\\nvidual CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, or shorter term family \\ntherapy, lasting at least three months) or systemic family therapy \\nor 30 weekly sessions of individual child psychotherapy.

The challenges fell broadly into three domains: \\n1. The limitations of the guideline’s scope based on the PICOTS (Population, \\nInterventions, Comparators, Outcomes, Timing, and Settings) chosen. \\n2. Constraints and applicability of the IOM guideline development standards to mental \\nhealth and particularly depression. \\n3. General and cohort-specific limitations of the current research literature.\\nConsiderations Regarding Guideline Scope\\nThe current guideline focused on the PICOTS (Population, Interventions, Comparators, \\nOutcomes, Timing, Settings) described in the introduction. The panel wanted to be as broadly \\ninclusive as possible, but nonetheless had to limit the areas of focus to rigorously evaluate a \\nsegment of literature in a realistic time frame. The panel therefore did not systematically \\nreview the literature relevant to a number of important populations (e.g., populations with \\nbipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or other medical disorders) and settings (e.g., collab -\\norative care, inpatient treatment). An additional area not captured by the panel was stepped \\ncare. Some clinicians, for example, may follow a stepped care approach to treatment based on the patient’s history of number of prior episodes of depression. Some of these components \\nnot reviewed by the panel were captured partially within the available reviews, but the pre -\\nsentation of the data prevented systematic recommendations. These decisions reflected the \\npanel’s desire to address questions of care relevant to the largest segment of individuals with \\ndepression and focus on topics of broadest interest to the membership of APA and related disciplines. The panel expects future efforts will expand on this and other guidelines to \\naddress important areas such as populations with comorbid medical disorders, populations \\nwith comorbid substance use disorders, collaborative care models, treatment specifically in \\nprimary care settings, alternative treatment modalities, and models using longer term or maintenance approaches to treatment. For example, there is emerging research regarding \\npromising Internet-based interventions in general and particularly for children and adoles -\\ncents (Reyes-Portillo et al., 2014). There is need for a more detailed examination of comple -\\nmentary and alternative interventions for depression than what was included in the current \\nguideline, as well as examination of the role of peer providers (individuals with lived experi -\\nence of depression) in treatment.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='52\\u2003APA \\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of DepressionAs noted previously, the guideline initially was going to only \\naddress treatment for adolescents. However, the available reviews \\noften included both children and adolescents together. The panel \\nincorporated children into the guideline, but because the original \\nsearch focused solely on adolescents, the sampling of the child lit -\\nerature is likely incomplete. In addition, while the literatures were \\noften combined, there are important developmental and theoret -\\nical reasons to consider children and adolescents separately. The \\npanel ultimately decided to separate recommendations for chil -\\ndren versus adolescents but was constrained in its ability to make \\nspecific recommendations for children due to the limited literature \\nfocusing exclusively on children included in the reviews. Future \\nefforts would benefit from a separate systematic review dedicated \\nto childhood depression.\\nAnother domain not included but that is an important priority \\nis universal prevention. The panel focused on treatment of depres -\\nsive disorders, determining this would be the domain of most inter -\\nest to the consumers of this report. However, the panel also rec -\\nognizes that preventive interventions are an important aspect of care, particularly for health care systems, and recommends that \\nfuture guidelines address prevention approaches (e.g., Horowitz & \\nGarber, 2006; Garber et al., 2009; Horowitz, Garber, Ciesla, Young, \\n& Mufson, 2007).\\nAs noted in the introduction, a number of areas were not \\naddressed in the PICOTS for the guideline, including screening for \\ndepression, assessment of associated or comorbid conditions (e.g., \\nsuicidality, medical problems), monitoring response to treatment \\nand follow-up after treatment, locus of care, primary prevention of \\ndepression, dose (differential beyond current recommended), tim -\\ning or duration of treatments for depression, costs of treatments, \\nspecific populations (e.g., caregivers), and mechanisms of change. \\nThese areas are important domains of investigation and comment. \\nThe panel has supplemented the guideline mechanisms in some \\nsections with information related to some of these domains when \\nappropriate, but the panel is supportive of future efforts to incor -\\nporate these domains formally into guidelines, where there is liter -\\nature available.\\nImplications of Alignment with the Institute of \\nMedicine Standards\\nIt is noted throughout this document that the current clinical practice \\nguideline development panel adopted the Institute of Medicine’s \\n(2011a) standards for guideline development. What are these stan -\\ndards? To begin with, the definition of a clinical practice guideline \\naccording to the IOM (2011a) involves “. . . statements that include \\nrecommendations intended to optimize patient care that are \\ninformed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of \\nthe benefits and harms of alternative care options” (p. 4).\\nHistorically, these standards are the product of a collabora -\\ntion between the IOM and the Agency for Health Care Research \\nand Quality in 2008. The impetus for this partnership was initial -\\nly called for by Congress and the then-Secretary of Health and \\nHuman Services as a means of empowering committees to con -\\nduct two major studies—one devoted to identifying standards for conducting systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness research, \\nand the second to develop standards for developing clinical prac -\\ntice guidelines. \\nThe first committee report describes the specific means by \\nwhich systematic reviews and meta-analyses are to be conducted. \\nElsewhere in the current document, it is noted that in order to fol -\\nlow IOM standards, it was important to generally include reviews \\nthat involved more than one individual to screen and select studies \\nto include in the review, as well as to extract quantitative data from \\neach study. In addition, although not a hard and fast standard, the'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='to include in the review, as well as to extract quantitative data from \\neach study. In addition, although not a hard and fast standard, the \\nIOM notes that systematic reviews become outdated at 5.5 years. \\nFollowing such guidance restricted our ability to incorporate those \\nreviews that did not meet such standards, regardless of the quality \\nof the review in all other aspects. However, when such restrictions \\nled to a major lack of information on which to base recommenda -\\ntions (see Method section as well as section below on constraints \\nusing the IOM standards), we did include meta-analyses that did \\nnot meet such standards but that did meet quality criteria per \\nAMSTAR review.  \\nAttempting to follow the standards and guidance set forth \\nby the IOM can be limiting if systematic reviews are not available \\n(see section below for additional detail), despite the existence of \\nmultiple individual studies. As such, developing clinical practice \\nguidelines that are “trustworthy” can be difficult. On one hand, it \\nbecomes crucial to follow scientifically sound protocols, such as the \\nIOM guidance. On the other hand, doing so can limit the ability to \\ndevelop clinical practice guidelines in such a manner that includes \\nall potentially relevant data. For example, several meta-analyses \\nthat are viewed by many as supportive of the efficacy of various \\npsychotherapies for depression are actually considered outdated \\nor do not meet the rigorous IOM standards. As such, although \\ninformation about the potential viability and efficacy of such ther -\\napies are at times in the “collective conscious” of the health pro -\\nfessions at large, it may not be included in current clinical practice \\nguidelines. The lack of studies to help answer questions regard -\\ning comparative effectiveness and the efficacy and relevance of \\nvarious treatments for ethnic minority populations is particularly \\nchallenging. The situation is even more complex as single studies \\nneed to be evaluated for quality (as with a meta-analysis or similar \\nendeavor) and typically do not have sufficient strength of evidence \\nalone to draw robust conclusions. \\nThis state of affairs leads to a scientific and profession -\\nal dilemma—should the panel have used IOM guidance? In the absence of any other “gold standard,” the answer is “yes” given \\nthat the ultimate goal is to produce a scientifically sound clinical \\npractice guideline. Alternatively, future efforts to create differing \\nclinical practice guideline development guidance, whether they \\nare slight variations of the current IOM standards or something \\ncreated by other agencies or professional groups, may yield more \\nviable approaches. The development of the original CONSORT \\n(Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement guidelines \\nprovided standards for reporting clinical trials in order to foster \\ntransparency and scholarship. Because the original CONSORT was \\ndeveloped for the general medical field, various extensions have \\nbeen developed to better suit differing populations, methodolog -\\nical approaches, and content. Relevant to this clinical practice'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 56}, page_content='APA\\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depression\\u2003 53guideline, a formal extension of the CONSORT guidelines is cur -\\nrently being developed by an international consensus group to be \\nrelevant and appropriate for clinical trials specific to social and psychological interventions, including psychotherapy trials (hence \\nthe title Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials—for Social \\nand Psychological Intervention Trials; Montgomery et al., 2013). In \\nthis vein, it is possible that the current IOM guidance may be the \\nstarting point but not the final best approach for developing clini-\\ncal practice guidelines that involve predominantly psychotherapy \\nresearch. The nature of both funding sources (e.g., requirements \\nto receive grants) and aspects of research design (e.g., inability to \\nblind participants to the treatment they receive) may require differ -\\nent criteria for evaluating the quality of research. This is, however, \\nperhaps also an empirical question. In the meantime, to pursue a \\nscientifically sound path, adopting the IOM guidance is considered \\nto be the best current approach. However, it is also important to \\nacknowledge limitations. The full reports for each of these devel -\\nopment standards are available online (IOM, 2011a; IOM, 2011b).  \\nThe panel was committed to ensuring the scientific rigor of the \\ndevelopment process by following the IOM standards for guideline development while simultaneously generating a guideline that was \\nbased on an adequate inclusion of the research literature. When \\nreviewing the original umbrella review of treatments conducted \\nby an evidence-based practice center for the panel, it became \\nclear that a large number of systematic reviews and meta-analy -\\nses were not included in that umbrella review due to not meeting \\nthe IOM standards, yet frequently these were the only reviews \\ncovering a key domain. The panel determined it could not create \\nan adequately meaningful guideline without broadening the inclu -\\nsion parameters and determined to consider reviews that did not \\nutilize a dual review process for selecting articles for inclusion. All \\nother requirements were maintained, such as excluding reviews \\nincluding trials that were not appropriately controlled. While sin -\\ngle review increases the risk of bias in article selection (Edwards \\net al., 2002), the panel in reviewing the literature determined that \\nthe guideline would not adequately cover the PICOTS (Population, \\nInterventions, Comparators, Outcomes, Timing, Settings) without \\nsome expansion of the available literature, and this modification \\nwas the most scientifically defensible of all options. All identified \\nreviews not conducted or evaluated by an evidence-based practice \\ncenter were evaluated by a scientist external to the guideline devel -\\nopment process using the AMSTAR criteria before including the \\nreviews in the evidence base. \\nEven with this expansion, there were some domains that were \\ninadequately addressed.  For example, there was only one study of \\npsychodynamic therapy identified in the child and adolescent lit -\\nerature reviews (Trowell et al., 2007), despite it being a common \\nmodality in the community (i.e., the IMPACT study in the United \\nKingdom; see Midgley & Kennedy, 2011). In another example, stud -\\nies of newer therapies such as schema-focused therapy, emotion-fo -\\ncused therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy, although \\nused in the community for treating depression, were not reviewed. \\nThese newer therapies were not covered in existing meta-analyses \\nthat were of high enough quality per AMSTAR standards and thus \\nwere not considered for a recommendation by the panel.  Use of \\nsmartphone-based treatment was not reviewed due to inadequate comparison conditions in the general adult population. Studies of \\nplay therapy varied greatly in definition of intervention (the one \\nstudy of acceptable quality focused on war-abducted youth, raising'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 56}, page_content='play therapy varied greatly in definition of intervention (the one \\nstudy of acceptable quality focused on war-abducted youth, raising \\nquestions of generalizability). Medication as a comparator across \\nthe age populations varied greatly in terms of quality of treatment \\nand conformity to standards of practice, with the physician mem -\\nbers of the panel noting that in some cases the standard doses were below recommended doses, or the medication was not used in cur -\\nrent practice (e.g., nefazodone). These limitations restricted the nature of the recommendations the panel could make.\\nPanel members did discuss whether there were ways to effec -\\ntively include research that did not depend on randomized con -\\ntrolled designs as generally those studies do not meet the quality \\ninclusion criteria for systematic review. In domains where there are \\nlimited randomized controlled trials available, it may be reasonable \\nto develop preliminary recommendations based on well-designed \\ncorrelational studies, particularly if there is longitudinal data avail -\\nable. The panel does recommend review of guideline development \\nprocesses to ensure emerging best practices are captured in APA’s processes and determine if specific modification may be indicated \\nfor guidelines related to mental and behavioral health. For example, \\nmaintaining a double-blind condition in a psychotherapy study is not possible (the provider and participant know the intervention \\nbeing provided), and this leads to such studies being judged as \\nlower quality. \\nLimitations of Existing Treatment Research \\nLiterature \\nIn creating this guideline, the panel had an opportunity to identify a \\nnumber of domains in which there are extensive needs for future \\nresearch.\\nExtensive evidence for a variety of treatments.  Depression is one \\nof the disorders most widely studied in psychotherapy research, with over 400 randomized clinical trials for depression across the last 3 \\ndecades (Cuijpers, van Straten, Warmerdam, & Andersson, 2008). \\nHowever, while a large number of studies focused on the efficacy of \\none approach, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), fewer studies \\nhave examined other widely utilized treatments including psychody -\\nnamic therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, behavioral activation, problem-solving therapy, and emotion-focused therapy, among \\nothers. Most of these treatments have demonstrated preliminary efficacy necessitating the need for further study. In addition, while \\nthe largest body of literature is for CBT, the definition of CBT is not the same across all CBT studies. This heterogeneity limits the ability to make conclusions about the CBT model. It is imperative that the \\nfield generate more evidence to support different psychotherapies \\n(with preliminary efficacy as this is crucial for the advancement of \\nthe scientific field, diversification of education, and training opportu-\\nnities for and adherence to scientific calls for personalized approaches \\nto treatment). There is also interest and awareness of growing areas \\nin complementary and alternative medicine such as those included in this review and others that were not included (such as emotional \\nsupport animals).'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 57}, page_content='54\\u2003APA \\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of DepressionSecondary outcomes. Symptomatic change (or reductions in the \\nseverity and duration of symptoms) has been widely considered the \\ngold standard for improvement in treatments of depression.  \\nHowever, it is important to consider patients’ improvement beyond \\nsymptom change. Very few studies have focused on investigating \\ntreatment gains in a wide range of functional domains of patient-cen -\\ntered outcomes, such as quality of life, employment status, integra -\\ntion in the community, social engagement, satisfaction in \\ninterpersonal relationships, etc. \\nLong-term outcomes of psychotherapy. There is still lack of suffi -\\ncient evidence on the enduring long-term effects of treatments for \\ndepression. While some evidence suggests that effects of some \\npsychotherapies persist longer than the effects of medication (e.g., \\nHollon & Ponniah, 2010; Cuijpers et al., 2013; Fonagy et al., 2015), \\nthere is still a need for data from long-term follow-ups with multiple \\ntime points. In that respect, understanding long-term change trajec-tories could also help researchers develop interventions that are \\nfocused on relapse prevention.\\nTreatment for patients with comorbid medical conditions. While \\nthere is a large body of literature demonstrating the relation between \\nvarious medical conditions (e.g., obesity, cardiovascular disease, \\nchronic pain, cancer) and depression, few randomized controlled \\ntrials have been conducted targeting depression among these popu -\\nlations. One of the reasons is that randomized controlled trials have \\nhad strict exclusion criteria, leaving outpatients suffering from \\ncomorbid conditions. Randomized controlled trials with strict exclu -\\nsion criteria have led to a better understanding of efficacy of treat -\\nments for this clearly defined and fairly homogenous population. \\nHowever, less is known about patient populations who do not fit this \\ncategory. Therefore, future research should examine some of the \\nmore commonly co-occurring physical ailments of depression like \\nstroke, diabetes, and cancer, as well as subsyndromal depression and substance use disorders.\\nTreatment for racially, ethnically, and gender diverse populations. \\nDespite the increasing awareness of the importance of accessibility \\nof mental health care for racially, ethnically, and gender diverse per -\\nsons and the emphasis on multiculturalism, the panel was unable to \\naddress depression within groups of people of color and other diverse \\ngroups across age cohorts.  For example, there is a growing yet lim -\\nited body of knowledge regarding conceptualizations of the etiology \\nof depression in people of color (Sontag-Padilla et al., 2016; Stein et \\nal., 2010), the diagnosis of depression in adults and youth of color \\n(Breland-Noble, Al-Mateen, & Singh, 2016; Breland-Noble, \\nSotomayor, & Burriss, 2015), and most effective delivery methods of \\ntreatment for these populations (Camacho et al., 2015).  Unfortunately, there is a dearth of evidence regarding treatment engagement and \\noutcomes for most racial ethnic groups in the U.S. (including adults \\nand youth), thereby restricting the panel’s ability to account for treat -\\nment response variability in relation to racial and ethnic group diver -\\nsity within the current guideline.  \\nFuture research must expand its inclusion of underserved and \\nunderrepresented populations in depression treatment research. \\nThere is particular need for more comprehensive sampling of these populations (e.g., often the youth of color included in studies are dis -\\nproportionately from communities experiencing individual-level and neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage). Within these \\nstudies, it is imperative that researchers identify culturally relevant \\nmeans of assessing depression in racially diverse populations. Doing \\nso would more accurately identify individuals in need of treatment \\nand utilize measures that are sensitive to the symptom changes of'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 57}, page_content='so would more accurately identify individuals in need of treatment \\nand utilize measures that are sensitive to the symptom changes of \\nthese populations throughout the course of treatment. Also, further \\nresearch is needed to examine culturally relevant outcomes of stan -\\ndardized interventions as well as interventions targeted specifically \\nto the needs of these diverse groups, such as school-based mental \\nhealth services for minority youth (Atkins, Frazier, Adil, & Talbott, \\n2003; Bear, Finer, Guo, & Lau, 2014; Langley, Nadeem, Kataoka, \\nStein, & Jaycox, 2010). Given preliminary evidence suggesting that \\nethnicity moderates treatment effects (e.g., Barber et al., 2012), \\nresearchers should focus on studying process and outcomes of psy -\\nchotherapies among racially, ethnically, and gender diverse popu -\\nlations (Perry, Chaplo, & Baucom, 2017). Of note, there are special \\nissues to consider when conducting research with diverse groups \\n(APA, 2017b; Council of National Psychological Associations for \\nthe Advancement of Ethnic Minority Interests, 2007). These issues \\ninclude training in multicultural competency to properly conduct \\nresearch with such individuals, using culturally relevant and appro -\\npriate assessment tools for a given group or subgroup, and including \\nindividuals of a particular minority population of research focus with -\\nin a larger stakeholder framework.\\nCohort specific limitations: Child and adolescent . Broadly, additional \\nstudies of psychotherapy interventions in general for diverse children \\nwith depression that include long-term follow-up are needed. While \\nthe field recognizes the benefits of interpersonal psychotherapy \\n(adapted for adolescents) and CBT for youth, the literature is cur -\\nrently insufficient for definitively stating which therapies are most \\nefficacious for specific populations (e.g., preadolescents, young children, and children of color). Also, more studies with children and \\nwith adolescents comparing active interventions are needed. \\nIn addition, the meta-analyses and reviews included a number \\nof indicated prevention focused studies in the analyses assessing \\nthe evidence base for depression interventions. These study par -\\nticipants endorsed depression symptoms albeit subsyndromal but \\nelevated enough that they were considered depressed. However, \\nthe target outcome for indicated prevention studies is preven -\\ntion of increasing symptom severity and acquisition of a depres -\\nsion diagnosis rather than recovery or remission from diagnosed \\ndepression. Combining prevention and intervention studies within \\nmeta-analyses may have obscured differences in outcomes of sim -\\nilar treatments with different targets, reducing the confidence in \\nstrength of effectiveness for a given treatment approach. \\nLimitations in older adults . Three of the most salient limitations of \\nthe intervention literature to date in late-life depression treatment \\nand prevention concern (1) the underrepresentation of racial and \\nethnic minority participants, (2) the relative dearth of participants \\namong the “oldest old” strata of society (i.e., those older than 75 or \\n80), and (3) the paucity of information on treatment response mod -\\nifiers.  There is increasing interest in testing measures of medical'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 58}, page_content='APA\\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depression\\u2003 55morbidity and of cognitive impairment as moderators of treatment \\nresponse, with early promising leads in these domains. Moreover, \\ncomparative effectiveness research is needed to address the treat -\\nment of depression in patients for whom treatments fail in later life. \\nDespite establishing that some psychotherapies are ben -\\neficial to older adults, the research literature is at best limited. \\nModerators of effect, such as health and cognitive status, are poor -\\nly understood. The majority of older adults included in treatment \\nstudies are younger older adults, and little is known about the ben -\\nefits of treatment for those in the eighth and ninth decades of life. \\nFinally, as is common across all age cohorts, the diversity of patient \\nsamples is minimal. \\nLast, family caregiver burden in the context of late-life depres -\\nsion is a significant public health issue. This underscores the impor -\\ntance of engaging family members in the process of care, both as \\nsources of reliable information about how a loved one with depres -\\nsion is doing, and also to foster engagement in and adherence to \\ntreatment for a sufficient period of time to realize and to sustain \\nmeaningful benefit. Family caregivers are frequently demoralized by \\ntheir loved one’s depression and welcome the opportunity to learn \\nmore about the illness and its treatment and resources for self-care.\\nOlder adult patients for whom treatment fails.   Similar to the general \\nadult population, there is also a great need for comparative effective -\\nness research because, as suggested by the Nelson et al. (2008) \\nmeta-analysis, existing treatments may benefit no more than half of \\nolder adults with major depression. Further, as noted above, there is \\nlimited information about moderators of treatment response (which \\ntreatment for which patient). Some practitioners advocate switching \\nclass of antidepressant, while others argue for the use of augmenta -\\ntion strategies. The data do not provide conclusive evidence for either \\nswitching or augmentation strategies. \\nJudging from the statistic numbers-needed-to-treat report -\\ned in randomized, placebo-controlled trials, antidepressant phar -\\nmacotherapy appears to be more effective in long-term or main -\\ntenance treatment (over 2–3 years), with respect to preventing \\nrecurrence of major depressive episodes, than in short-term use \\n(up to 12 weeks) with respect to rates of response or remission. A \\nmeta-analysis by Kok and colleagues (Kok, Heeren, & Nolen, 2011; \\nKok, Nolen, & Heeren, 2012) estimated a number needed to treat \\nof 3.4. The clinical relevance of this observation is considerable, \\ngiven the risk for a chronic, relapsing course in late-life depres -\\nsion (Kok & Reynolds, 2017). There is yet, however, no strong evi -\\ndence-based consensus about which patients need maintenance \\npharmacotherapy, apart from those with three or more episodes of \\nmajor depression.\\nThe modest efficacy of antidepressant pharmacotherapy needs \\nto be weighed against side-effect burden and adverse effects, espe -\\ncially in frail older adults with medical poly-morbidity. Potential \\nsafety concerns in older adults treated with antidepressants include \\ndrug–drug interactions, hyponatremia, falls and fractures, gastroin -\\ntestinal bleeding, cardiovascular effects, and bone metabolism/oste -\\noporosis. At the same time, however, evidence-based management \\nof late-life depression in primary care patients (where most patients \\nare treated), in which both pharmacotherapy and learning-based \\npsychotherapies (interpersonal psychotherapy and problem-solving therapy) are offered, has demonstrated moderately higher levels of \\ntreatment response and remission versus care as usual (Bruce et al., \\n2004; Unützer et al., 2002). It has further demonstrated reduction \\nin long-term rates of mortality from co-occurring medical conditions \\n(Gallo et al., 2013). Thus, both the short- and long-term risks and'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 58}, page_content='in long-term rates of mortality from co-occurring medical conditions \\n(Gallo et al., 2013). Thus, both the short- and long-term risks and \\nbenefits of antidepressant pharmacotherapy in older adults, togeth -\\ner with patient preferences, need to be carefully weighed in shared \\ndecision-making with patients and families.\\nNeed for a Clearer Taxonomy of \\nPsychotherapies\\nThe great deal of variability in what is grouped in a review as a par -\\nticular form of psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive therapy, psychody -\\nnamic therapy, etc.) also interferes with establishing clear treatment \\nguidelines. The panel, in some cases, had difficulty determining what \\nwas included in categories in reviews and how the determinations \\nwere made and, at times, questioned whether treatments should be \\ngrouped together. For example, group and individual psychodynamic \\npsychotherapy were grouped together in a meta-analysis (Driessen \\net al., 2015) with an outcome suggesting less efficacy than other \\ntreatment approaches. However, when only individual treatments \\nwere analyzed, there was no difference between psychodynamic and \\nother treatment approaches (Driessen et al., 2015) which is consis-\\ntent with Barber et al. (2012). Similarly, a well-defined model of \\npsychotherapy, emotion-focused therapy, was grouped in reviews \\nunder “non-specific and supportive models” (Cuijpers, Driessen, et \\nal., 2012a). Experts indicate that this is a mis-categorization, but the \\ncategorization resulted in masking potential evidence regarding effi -\\ncacy of this intervention. \\nOther times, the same or similar labels were used to describe \\napproaches that are actually quite different from each other. For \\ninstance, although conceptually similar, psychoanalysis, psycho -\\nanalytic psychotherapy, brief psychodynamic psychotherapy, and \\ninterpersonal psychotherapy are also different regarding emphasis, \\nfocus, strategies, length of treatment, and hypothesized mecha -\\nnisms of action. Although this labeling issue exists and was rec -\\nognized by the panel, the panel strove to use labels similar to the \\ninvestigators in order to maintain consistency with the language \\nused by investigators as well as to maintain a sufficient sampling \\nof studies under each treatment approach. However, it is possible \\nthat the outcomes of meta-analyses and reviews might be differ -\\nent based on alternate groupings of interventions (i.e., cognitive \\ntherapy alone or combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy or \\nbehavioral therapy for analyses) potentially resulting in differ -\\nent evaluations of effectiveness.  Given this possibility, there is a \\nneed for formal efforts at developing a more universal taxonomy \\nof psychotherapies that can better categorize shared and unique \\nfeatures of interventions incorporated in specific treatments. The \\npanel strongly recommends that researchers carefully operation -\\nalize and specifically define the treatment approach that they are \\ninvestigating and label accordingly.  The problem is compounded \\nby the fact that it is often hard to know how the actual treatments \\nwere delivered, how adherent the therapists were, and how much \\n“borrowing” from other treatment modalities was done.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 59}, page_content='56\\u2003APA \\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of DepressionNeed for Rigorous Comparisons of Treatments \\nand Treatment Modality\\nDespite the increasing number of studies and meta-analyses com -\\nparing different treatments, the differences, process, and outcome \\ndata on different treatments remains elusive (Cuijpers, 2015; Cuijpers \\net al., 2008), and more rigorous treatment comparisons of psycho -\\nlogical interventions are needed.  One of the most challenging and \\nyet pressing needs is developing methods to evaluate the contribu -\\ntion of specific aspects of psychotherapy models compared with the \\nshared or nonspecific aspects.  In particular, designs that use a gen -\\neral form of psychotherapy that represents the shared components \\nof effective models as a control condition would contribute to \\nimproving the ability to separate out the unique contributions of \\nspecific models. Fewer studies have compared the efficacy of individ -\\nual modalities of treatment versus group modalities.  One of the \\nbiggest research gaps in terms of treatment implications is the eval-\\nuation of either the efficacy of treatments delivered in a group format \\nor comparisons of a treatment delivered in an individual format to \\ntreatment in a group format. Given how frequently group is the \\nmodality of treatment in certain settings (i.e., Veteran’s Administration \\nand psychiatric hospitals), better data on its comparability to tradi -\\ntional individual therapy is imperative.\\nAnother important domain is assessing new models of deliv -\\nering previously supported approaches. This includes delivery in \\nnew environments (e.g., primary care, in home) and through the \\nuse of new technologies (e.g., phone, video-conferencing, Internet, \\nsmartphone apps). The panel found that some reviews lumped dif -\\nferent settings or technologies together, limiting the panel’s ability \\nto make comparisons.\\nImproving Methodology and Reporting in \\nTreatment Studies \\nAlong these lines, it is critical that randomized controlled trials test -\\ning theoretically sound interventions be designed using the principles \\nof available study design guidelines (e.g., Consolidated Standards of \\nReporting Trials, Journal Article Reporting Standards—Altman et al., \\n2001; Appelbaum et al., 2018; Levitt et al., 2018). The design features \\nthat the panel encourages researchers to adopt include: adequate \\ncontrol conditions (waitlist controls can artificially inflate effect sizes; \\nFurukawa et al., 2014); clear definitions of both active and control \\nconditions; extended long-term follow-up; comparisons between \\ntreatment modalities (e.g., group vs. individual); direct comparisons \\nof dosage differences (e.g., number, length, or frequency of sessions) \\nfor psychotherapies; definition and assessment of training in the \\nintervention; and assessment of competence in and fidelity to the intervention. The panel was concerned that many studies included in \\nreviews provided an insufficient summary/ description of important \\ncomponents of their study design. Specifically, a number of studies \\ndid not provide information on the training and competence of the \\nproviders, which again limits the ability to determine strength of \\nrecommendations, as it is not known whether the treatment was \\nadequately delivered when under evaluation. In addition, the panel supports articles including links to archives and appendices to facil -\\nitate transparency and replicability, especially when journals allow \\nvery limited number of words. This can be particularly helpful with \\npublication of treatment manuals associated with specific interven -\\ntions. The panel also supports incorporating a section on harms and \\nburdens in reports on psychotherapy trials, consistent with the stan -\\ndard practice in pharmacotherapy research. Throughout the process \\nof completing this guideline, the inability to assess harms and bur -\\ndens of specific interventions was a major obstacle to having confi -'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 59}, page_content='of completing this guideline, the inability to assess harms and bur -\\ndens of specific interventions was a major obstacle to having confi -\\ndence in recommendations for psychotherapies. In terms of outcomes, \\nthe panel notes the need for longer term outcomes and supports \\nresearchers using the 5R model (response, remission, recovery, \\nrelapse and recurrence; Frank et al., 1991) for defining symptom out -\\ncomes. End of treatment response and remission (e.g., brief period of \\nsymptom improvement) are typically reported (Frank et al., 1991). \\nHowever, recovery (e.g., depressive episode has been in remission for \\nan extended period of time), relapse (e.g., re-emergence of depres -\\nsive episode during a prior period of remission) and recurrence (e.g., \\nre-emergence of symptoms during a prior period of recovery) are \\nalso meaningful outcomes for evaluating treatments but are much \\nless commonly reported. Yet the outcomes of recovery, relapse, and \\nrecurrence are critical for understanding the endurance of treatment \\neffects (Frank et al., 1991). The panel also supports expanded incor -\\nporation of clinical significance (i.e., evaluating whether change of \\ntreatment leads to clinically meaningful difference such as changing \\nfrom meeting diagnostic criteria to no longer meeting criteria) for \\nevaluating outcomes in addition to the traditional use of statistical \\nsignificance.\\nT esting Moderators and Mediators of Treatment \\nOutcome\\nSome psychotherapy research demonstrated that, after treatment \\ncompletion, more than half of patients remained depressed (Thase et al., 1997), and of those who improved by the end of treatment, \\nabout 40% experienced a relapse in depressive symptoms (Steinert, \\nHofmann, Kruse, & Leichsenring, 2014). Little is known about the \\nreasons behind patient deterioration or lack of improvement, and \\nless still about how to help patients achieve and maintain treatment \\ngains. The panel believes that researchers should focus their efforts \\non outcomes as well as on the identification of moderators of treat -\\nment outcomes to identify characteristics that predict treatment \\nfailure/success. More specifically, if a given treatment protocol has \\nbeen found to be efficacious, for example, in comparison to no treat -\\nment, a large portion of the sample may still have not responded fully \\n(or at all).  Testing the moderator variables associated with who does \\nand does not respond to a treatment is a next step in improving the ability to develop and improve treatments, although doing so will \\nrequire much larger sample sizes in order to have sufficient power to \\ntest those hypotheses. Moderator variables can include a wide range \\nof patient characteristics (e.g., sex, age, symptom severity, comor -\\nbidity, religion, physical health status), treatment-related factors \\n(e.g., therapist competency, setting, treatment dose), and per -\\nson-centered outcomes (e.g., treatment preferences, treatment cost \\nand accessibility).

Last, \\nstudies should examine the efficacy of a step-wise approach like \\nswitching patients from medication to types of psychotherapies (or \\nvice versa) in cases of treatment failure (see Rush et al., 2006, for \\npreliminary evidence). Ultimately, the goal of such research is to \\nbetter understand how to make the treatment more effective for all \\npersons or to better understand for which individuals the treatment \\nis not recommended.\\nFunding Needs\\nGiven the complexity and large amount of resources required to \\nconduct scientifically valid randomized clinical trials (Barber, 2009; \\nNezu & Nezu, 2008), it is understandable that available high-quality \\nresearch is limited. Funding is highly competitive and thus available \\nto a relatively small number of investigators. To address the many \\nquestions raised in this document, it will require more investment in \\ncomplex and expensive research across many investigative teams. In \\nparticular, key questions of moderators and mediators of treatment response require much larger sample sizes than are typical of current psychotherapy research studies.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 61}, page_content='58\\u2003APA \\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of DepressionCONCLUSION\\nOverall these limitations require caution and conservative recommendations given the gaps \\nin the depression intervention literature. Thus, while the panel makes recommendations \\nbased on following the IOM (2011a) criteria for rigorous guideline development, the panel is \\naware of the limits of its assessment and scope of its recommendations. The field is strongly \\nurged to address significant issues related to study design and standardization of methodol -\\nogy (e.g., consistent inclusion of racially diverse populations, and consistency in defining \\ntreatments and measurement of outcomes). Further the field is encouraged to generate \\nadditional research and reviews on humanistic therapies, emotion-focused therapy, and dif -\\nferent treatment modalities.  Altogether, the current guideline makes an important contribu -\\ntion to the field and complements existing knowledge by addressing treatment of depression \\nfrom childhood through older adulthood, including an examination of psychotherapeutic \\ninterventions. Moreover, this guideline was developed following the IOM (2011a) standards \\nfor trustworthy guideline development. Finally, this guideline is an outgrowth of APA’s evi -\\ndence-based practice policy and is predicated on the three domains noted in earlier work by \\nboth the IOM and APA (American Psychological Association Presidential Task Force on \\nEvidence-Based Practice, 2006) integrating the best available research; practitioner exper -\\ntise; and patient culture, values and preferences.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/pdfs/APA_guideline.pdf', 'page': 62}, page_content='APA\\u2003|\\u2003Guideline for the Treatment of Depression\\u2003 59Conflicts of Interest\\nPrior to final appointment to the panel, candidates completed a \\nconflict of interest (COI) form that was then reviewed by the advi -\\nsory steering committee or APA staff to ensure there were no iden -\\ntified conflicts that would prohibit participation, with the \\nunderstanding that some “adversarial conflict” representing differ -\\nent points of views was to be expected and encouraged in this pro -\\ncess. While intellectual affiliations were expected, no panel members \\nhad been singularly identified with particular approaches to inter -\\nvention nor had significant known financial conflicts. Once the panel \\nwas formed, all panel members completed an educational module \\non conflicts of interest that underscored the importance of identify -\\ning and managing any potential conflicts, both financial and intellec-\\ntual. The APA conflicts of interest policy and disclosure form are \\nincluded in the appendix.\\nAll panel members and staff affiliated with development of \\nthe depression clinical practice guideline updated their conflicts of \\ninterest form on an annual basis and were asked to provide more \\ntimely updates if changes in their disclosures were perceived to \\nbe relevant to the development of the guideline. All were asked to \\ndisclose all potential conflicts of interest with the understanding \\nthat these would be reviewed and evaluated, and a decision would \\nbe made regarding how to manage identified conflicts. Conflicts of \\ninterest included not only possibilities for financial or professional \\ngain, but also strong intellectual viewpoints that might then limit \\nsomeone from objectively reviewing the evidence.  Emphasis was \\nplaced on disclosing all potential conflicts and allowing the staff \\nand chair (or other appropriate entity in the case of the chair) to \\nreview the disclosures and determine whether or not such infor -\\nmation could reasonably be construed as to be a source of possi-\\nble influence on the guideline development process.  Furthermore, \\non first joining the initiative and at the initial face-to-face meeting, \\npanel members were asked to verbalize their conflicts, so all pres -\\nent would be familiar with the diversity of perspectives and range \\nof possible influences. This practice continued at subsequent face-\\nto-face meetings. \\nAll authors were required to disclose their intellectual inter -\\nests, financial and professional interests, interests related to APA, \\nand other relevant interests. They were also required to disclose \\ninterests of family members, defined as “a spouse, domestic part -\\nner, parent, child, or other relative with whom [they] have a com -\\nparably close tie.” Authors were asked to disclose the following potential conflicts of interest: scientific/educational/professional \\ncommunications, communications to a general audience, roles \\nat APA or other organizations, relevant honoraria, endorsements, \\nresearch funding or royalties, payment for services or training, and \\nserving as expert witnesses. None of the reported potential con -\\nflicts of interest precluded a nominated candidate from serving on \\nthe guideline development panel. Excluding all guideline develop -\\nment panel candidates with any potential conflicts of interest risks \\nexcluding the level and type of expertise needed to fully evaluate \\ntreatment benefits and risks.

However, these experts may possess unique insight into \\nappropriate health care needs and recommendations.\\nThere is growing recognition that financial relations to the \\npharmaceutical industry threaten the integrity of research and of \\nclinical practice guidelines.
