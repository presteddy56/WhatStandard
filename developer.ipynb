The \\nassessment must be based on detailed history, physical \\nexamination and mental state examinations.History must be \\nobtained from all sources, especially the family. The diagnosis \\nmust be recorded as per the current diagnostic criteria. \\nDepression often presents with a combination of \\nsymptoms of depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, \\ndecreased energy and fatigue, reduced concentration \\nand attention,  reduced self-esteem and self-confidence, \\nideas of guilt and unworthiness, bleak and pessimistic \\nviews of the future, ideas or acts of self-harm or suicide, \\ndisturbed sleep and diminished appetite. Depending on \\nthe severity of depression some of these symptoms may \\nbe more marked and develop characteristic features that \\nare widely regarded as having special clinical significance. \\nThese symptoms are known as somatic symptoms of \\ndepression and include symptoms of loss of interest or \\npleasure in activities that are normally enjoyable, lack of \\nemotional reactivity to normally pleasurable surroundings \\nand events, waking up in the morning 2 hours or more \\nbefore the usual time, depression worse in the morning,  \\nobjective evidence of definite psychomotor retardation \\nor agitation (remarked on or reported by other people), \\nmarked loss of appetite, weight loss (often defined as 5% \\nor more of body weight in the past month) and marked \\nloss of libido. It is important to note that for the diagnosis \\nof depressive disorder these symptoms need to be present \\nfor at least 2 weeks and need to be associated with \\npsychosocial dysfunction.

S Sathyanarayana Rao\\nINTRODUCTION\\nDepression is a common disorder, which often leads to \\npoor quality of life and impaired role functioning. It is \\nknown to be a major contributor to the global burden \\nof diseases and according to World Health Organization \\n(WHO), depression is the fourth leading cause of disability \\nworldwide and it is projected that by 2020, it will be \\nthe second most common leading cause of disability. \\nDepression is also associated with high rates of suicidal \\nbehaviour and mortality. When depression occurs in the \\ncontext of medical morbidity, it is associated with increased \\nhealth care cost, longer duration of hospitalization, poor \\ncooperation in treatment, poor treatment compliance and \\nhigh rates of morbidity. Depression is also known to be \\nassociated with difficulties in role transitions (e.g., low \\neducation, high teen child-bearing, marital disruption, \\nunstable  employment) and poor role functioning (e.g., \\nlow marital quality, low work performance, low earnings). \\nIt is also reported to be a risk factor for the onset and \\npersistence of a wide range of secondary disorders. \\nAvailable data also suggests that between one-third \\nand one-half of patients also experience recurrence of \\ndepressive episodes.

Evaluation of history also takes into consideration \\nthe relationship of onset of depression with change in \\nseason (seasonal affective disorder), peripartum period and \\nphase of menstrual cycle.  Further, the longitudinal course \\napproach may also take into account response to previous \\ntreatment and whether the patient achieved full remission, \\npartial remission and did not respond to treatment. \\nAn important aspect of diagnosis of depression is to rule \\nout bipolar disorder. Many patients with bipolar disorder \\npresent to the clinicians during the depressive phase of \\nillness and spontaneously do not report about previous \\nhypomanic or manic episodes. Careful history from the \\npatient and other sources (family members) often provide \\nimportant clues for the bipolar disorder. It is often useful to \\nuse standardized scales like mood disorder questionnaire to \\nrule out bipolarity. Treating a patient of bipolar depression \\nas unipolar disorder can increase the risk of antidepressant induced switch. Presence of psychotic features, marked \\npsychomotor retardation, reverse neurovegetative \\nsymptoms (excessive sleep and appetite), irritability of \\nmood, anger, family history of bipolar disorder and early \\nage of onset need to  alert the clinicians to evaluate for the \\npossibility of bipolar disorder, before concluding that they \\nare dealing with unipolar depression.  \\nArea to be covered in assessment include symptom \\ndimensions, symptom-severity, comorbid psychiatric and \\nmedical conditions, particularly comorbid substance abuse, \\nthe risk of harm to self or others, level of functioning and \\nthe socio-cultural milieu of the patient. \\nIn case patient has received treatment in the past, it is \\nimportant to evaluate the information in the form of type of \\nantidepressant used, dose of medication used, compliance \\nwith medication, reasons for poor compliance, reasons for \\nPatient with Depressive features\\nConsider differential diagnoses lik e\\n• Organic Depression, medication induced depression,\\n substance induced depression, premenstrual dysphoric\\n disorde r\\n• Rule out bipolar disorde r\\nEstablish the diagnosis of Depression\\nAssessment\\n• Severity of illness \\n• Risk of harm to self and others- current suicidal ideations, suicidal attempts ;\\n past history of non-suicidal self-harm behaviour, past history of suicidal attempts ,\\n severity of attempt\\n• Comorbid substance use/dependenc e\\n• Personality factor s\\n• Level of functioning- work dysfunction\\n• Detailed Physical examination- thyroid swelling, evidence for nutritional deficiency,\\n and physical illness which could contribute to depression\\n• Record- blood pressure, weight and wherever indicated body mass index and wais t\\n circumference\\n• Mental Status Examination\\n• Investigations- haemogram, liver function test, renal function test, fasting blood glucose level,\\n thyroid function test (if required), Urine pregnancy test (if required )\\n• Treatment history- response to previous medication trials, compliance, side effects, etc.\\n• Patient’s and caregivers beliefs about the cause of illness and beliefs about the treatment \\n• Assessment for social support, stigma, coping \\n• Assessment of caregiver burden, coping and distres s\\n• Decide about treatment setting - consider inpatient care in case of suicidality, malnutrition,\\n catatonia,  comorbid general medical conditions making management difficult at th e\\n outpatient setting\\n• Liaison with other specialists depending on the need of the patient  \\nPharmacological Management\\n• Choose an antidepressant based on pas t\\n treatment response, past history of side\\n effects, cost, comorbidity, patient/family\\n preference, availability Electroconvulsive therapy\\n• Catatonia, suicidality,\\n severe depression, pas t\\n response to ECT,\\n augmentation etc.Non-Pharmacological\\nManagement \\n• Psychoeducation \\n• Psychotherapeutic\\n intervention'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/clinical_practice_guidelines_for_the_management_of.11.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='• Catatonia, suicidality,\\n severe depression, pas t\\n response to ECT,\\n augmentation etc.Non-Pharmacological\\nManagement \\n• Psychoeducation \\n• Psychotherapeutic\\n intervention\\nFigure 1:  Initial evaluation and management plan for Depression \\nDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/indianjpsychiatry by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4\\nXMi0hCywCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC4/OAVpDDa8KKGKV0Ymy+78= on 09/18/2024'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/clinical_practice_guidelines_for_the_management_of.11.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Gautam, et al.: CPGs for depressionIndian J Psychiatry 59 (Supplement 1), January 2017 S37discontinuation of medication, response to treatment, side \\neffects experienced etc. If the medications were changed, \\nthen the reason for change is also to be evaluated. \\nWherever possible, unstructured assessments need to be \\nsupplemented by ratings on appropriate standardized \\nrating scales.

The use of neuroimaging may be \\nindicated in those with first-episode of depression seen in \\nlate or very late age; those have neurological signs, those \\nhaving treatment resistant depression.\\nBesides, patients, information about the illness need to be \\nobtained from the caregivers too and their knowledge and \\nunderstanding of the illness, their attitudes and beliefs \\nregarding treatment, the impact of the illness on them and \\ntheir personal and social resources need to be evaluated.\\nFORMULATING A TREATMENT PLAN ( FIGURE -1)\\nFormulation of treatment plan involves deciding about \\ntreatment setting, medications and psychological treatments \\nto be used. Patients and caregivers may be actively consulted \\nwhile preparing the treatment plan. A practical, feasible and \\nflexible treatment plan can be formulated to address the needs \\nof the patients and caregivers. Further the treatment plan can \\nbe continuously re-evaluated and modified as required. \\nEV ALUATE THE SAFETY OF PATIENT AND \\nOTHERS\\nA careful assessment of the patient’s risk for suicide should \\nbe done. During history inquiry for the presence of suicidal \\nideation and other associated factors like presence of \\npsychotic symptoms, severe anxiety, panic attacks and \\nalcohol or substance abuse which increases the risk of suicide  \\nneed to  be evaluated. It has been found that severity of \\ndepressive symptomatology is a strong predictor of suicidal \\nideation over time in elderly patients. Evaluation also includes \\nhistory of past suicide attempts including the nature of those \\nattempts. Patients also need to be asked about suicide in their \\nfamily history. During the mental status examinations besides \\nenquiring about the suicidal ideations, it is also important to \\nenquire about the degree to which the patient intends to act \\non the suicidal ideation and the extent to which the patient has \\nmade plans or begun to prepare for suicide.  The availability \\nof means for suicide be inquired about and a judgment may \\nbe made concerning the lethality of those means. Patients \\nwho are found to possess suicidal or homicidal ideation, \\nintention or plans require close monitoring. Measures such as \\nhospitalization may be considered for those at significant risk. \\nCHOICE OF TREATMENT SETTINGS\\nMajority of the cases of depression seen in the clinical \\nsetting are of mild to moderate severity and can be managed at the outpatient setting. However, some patients have \\nsevere depression which may be further associated with \\npsychotic symptoms, catatonic symptoms, poor physical \\nhealth status, suicidal or homicidal behaviour etc. In such \\ncases, careful evaluation is to be done to decide about the \\ntreatment setting and whenever necessary inpatient care \\nmay be offered. In general, the rule of thumb is that the \\npatients may be treated in the setting that is most safe and \\neffective. Severely ill patients who lack adequate social \\nsupport outside of a hospital setting may be considered \\nfor admission to a hospital whenever feasible. The optimal \\ntreatment setting and the patient’s ability to benefit \\nfrom a different level of care may be re-evaluated on an \\nongoing basis throughout the course of treatment. Some \\nof the common indications for inpatient care are shown \\nin Table -4. \\nTable 4: Some indications for inpatient care during \\nacute episodes\\n• Presence of suicidal behaviour which puts the life of the patient at risk'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/clinical_practice_guidelines_for_the_management_of.11.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='in Table -4. \\nTable 4: Some indications for inpatient care during \\nacute episodes\\n• Presence of suicidal behaviour which puts the life of the patient at risk\\n• Refusal to eat which puts the life of patient at risk• Severe malnutrition• Catatonia•  Presence of general medical or comorbid psychiatric conditions that make outpatient treatment unsafe or ineffective\\nAll inpatients should have accompanying family caregivers. \\nIn case inpatient care facilities are not available, than the \\npatient and/or family need to be informed about such a \\nneed and admission in nearest available inpatient facility \\ncan be facilitated.  \\nTHERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE\\nIrrespective of the treatment modalities selected for \\npatients, it is important for the psychiatrist to establish a \\ntherapeutic alliance with the patient. A strong treatment \\nalliance between patient and psychiatrist is crucial for poorly \\nmotivated, pessimistic depressed patient who are sensitive \\nto side effect of medications. A positive therapeutic alliance \\nalways generates hope for good outcome.\\nENHANCED TREATMENT COMPLIANCE\\nThe successful treatment of major depressive disorder \\nrequires adequate compliance to treatment plan. Patients \\nwith depressive disorder may be poorly motivated and \\nunduly pessimistic over their chances of recovery with \\ntreatment. In addition, the side effect or requirements of \\ntreatment may lead to non-adherence. Patients are to be \\nencouraged to articulate any concern regarding adherence \\nand clinicians need to emphasize the importance of \\nadherence for successful treatment.

Antidepressant medication may be used as \\ninitial treatment modality for patients with mild, moderate, \\nor severe depressive episode.  The selection of antidepressant \\nmedications may be based on patient specific and drug specific \\nfactors, as given in Table -7. In general, because of the side \\neffect and safety profile, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \\n(SSRIs) are considered to be the first line antidepressants. Other \\npreferred options include tricyclic antidepressants, mirtazapine, \\nbupropion, and venlafaxine. Usually the medication must be \\nstarted in the lower doses and the doses must be titrated, \\ndepending on the response and the side effects experienced. \\nDose and duration of antidepressants\\nPatients who have started taking an antidepressant \\nmedication should be carefully monitored to assess the response to pharmacotherapy as well as the emergence of \\nside effects and safety. Factors to consider when determining \\nthe frequency of monitoring include severity of illness, \\npatient’s co-operation with treatment, the availability of \\nsocial support and the presence of comorbid general medical \\nproblems. Visits may be kept frequent enough to monitor \\nand address suicidality and to promote treatment adherence. \\nImprovement with pharmacotherapy can be observed after \\n4-6 weeks of treatment. If at least a moderate improvement is \\nnot observed in this time period, reappraisal and adjustment \\nof the pharmacotherapy should be considered.\\nPsychotherapeutic interventions \\nA specific, effective psychotherapy may be considered \\nas an initial treatment modality for patients with mild to \\nmoderate depressive disorder. Clinical features that may \\nsuggest the use of a specific psychotherapy include the \\npresence of significant psychosocial stressors, intrapsychic \\nconflict and interpersonal difficulties. Patient’s preference \\nfor psychotherapeutic approaches is an important \\nfactor that may be considered in the decision to use \\npsychotherapy as the initial treatment modality. Pregnancy, \\nlactation, orthe wish to become pregnant may also be an \\nindication for psychotherapy as an initial treatment.

In general, the \\nsame issues that influence the choice of medication or \\npsychotherapy when used alone should be considered \\nwhen choosing treatments for patients receiving combined \\ntherapy. \\nPHASES OF ILLNESS/TREATMENT\\nManagement of depression can be broadly divided into three \\nphases, i.e., acute phase, continuation phase and maintenance \\nphase. Maintenance phase of treatment is usually considered \\nwhen patient has recurrent depressive disorder.  ACUTE PHASE TREATMENT\\nThe goal of acute phase treatment is to achieve remission, \\nas presence of residual symptoms increase the risk of \\nchronic depression, poor quality of life and also impairs \\nrecovery from physical illness. Treatment generally results \\nin improvement in quality of life and better functional \\ncapacity. The various components of acute phase treatment \\nare shown in Table -10 and the treatment algorithm is shown \\nin figure-2 and 3.\\nIn acute phase psychiatrist may choose between \\nseveral initial treatment modalities, including \\npharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, the combination of \\nmedication and psychotherapy, or ECT. Selection of an \\ninitial treatment modality is usually influenced by both \\nclinical (e.g. severity of symptoms) and other factors \\n(e.g. patient preference). \\nAntidepressant medication may be used as initial treatment \\nmodality for patients with mild, moderate, or severe major \\ndepressive disorder. Clinical features that may suggest that \\nmedication are the preferred treatment modality includes \\nhistory of prior positive response to antidepressant \\nmedication, severity of symptoms, significant sleep and \\nappetite disturbance,  agitation, or anticipation of the need \\nfor maintenance therapy. Patients with severe depression \\nwith psychotic features will require use of combination of \\nantidepressant and antipsychotic medication and/or ECT.\\nThe initial selection of an antidepressant medication is \\nlargely be based on the anticipated side effects, the safety \\nor tolerability of these side effects for individual patients, \\npatient preference and comorbid physical illnesses. \\nDose and duration of antidepressants:  Once an \\nantidepressant medication has been selected, it can be \\nstarted initially at lower doses and careful monitoring to \\nTable 8: Psychotherapeutic interventions for Depression\\nType of therapy\\nCognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) •  Identifying problems, Identifying cognitive distortions/errors, generating alternative thoughts, \\nproblem solving, mastery and pleasure rating, activity scheduling, anxiety management'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/clinical_practice_guidelines_for_the_management_of.11.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='problem solving, mastery and pleasure rating, activity scheduling, anxiety management \\nstrategies‑ relaxation exercises\\nInterpersonal Therapy (IPT) •  Focuses on losses, role disputes and transitions, social isolation, deficits in social skills, and other \\ninterpersonal factor that may impact on the development of depression\\nSupportive psychotherapy •  Allowing the patient to ventilate, providing emotional support, guidance, increasing the patient’ s \\nself‑esteem, accepting feelings at face value, enhancing hope, enhancing adaptive coping\\nBehavioral Therapy (BT) • Activity scheduling, social skills training and problem solving\\nMarital Therapy (MT) •  Marital therapy conceptualizes depression as an interpersonal context such that both members of \\nthe marital dyad are included in therapy.

The treatment algorithm to be followed is \\nshown in figure-4. Patients who have been treated with \\nantidepressants in the acute phase need to be maintained on \\nsame dose of these agents for 16-24 weeks to prevent relapse \\n(total period of 6-9 month from initiation of treatment). There \\nare evidences to support the use of specific psychotherapy \\nin continuation phase to prevent relapse. The use of other \\nsomatic modalities (e.g. ECT) may be useful in patients where \\npharmacology and/or psychotherapy have failed to maintain \\nstability in continuation phase. The frequency of visit during \\nthe continuation phase may be determined by patient’s clinical \\ncondition as well as the specific treatment being provided. If \\nmaintenance phase treatment is not indicated for patients who \\nremain s table  following the continuation phase, patients may \\nbe considered for discontinuation of treatment. If treatment \\nis discontinued, careful monitoring be done for relapse, and \\ntreatment to be promptly reinstituted if relapse occurs.\\nTREATMENT IN MAINTENENCE PHASE\\nThe goal of maintenance phase treatment is to prevent recurrence \\nof depressive episodes. On an average, 50-85% of patients with \\na single episode of major depression have at least one more \\nepisodes. Therefore, maintenance phase treatment may be \\nconsidered to prevent recurrence. The duration of treatment \\nmay be decided keeping in view the previous treatment history \\nand number of depressive episodes the person has had in the \\npast. Mostly the treatment that was effective for acute and \\ncontinuation phase need to be used in the maintenance phase \\n(Figure-5). Same doses of antidepressants, to which the patient \\nhad responded in previous phase is considered. The frequency \\nof visit for CBT and IPTcan be reduced during the maintenance \\nphase (once a month). There is no consensus regarding the \\nduration and when to give and when not to give maintenance \\ntreatment. There is agreement to large extent that patients \\nwho have history of three or more relapses or recurrences need \\nto be given long-term treatment. \\nDISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT\\nThe decision to discontinue maintenance treatment may \\nbe based on the same factors considered in the decision to \\ninitiate maintenance treatment, including the probability \\nof recurrence, the frequency and severity of past episodes, \\nthe persistence of depressive symptoms after recovery, the \\npresence of comorbid disorders, and patient preferences. \\nWhen the decision is made to discontinue or terminate \\npsychotherapy in the maintenance phase, the manner in \\nwhich this is done may be individualized to the patient’s \\nneeds. When the decision is made to discontinue maintenance \\npharmacotherapy, it is best to taper the medication over \\nthe course of at least several weeks to few months. Such \\ntapering may allow for the detection of emerging symptoms \\nor recurrences when patients are still partially treated and \\ntherefore can be easily returned to full therapeutic intensity. \\nIn addition, such tapering can help minimize the risks of an anticonvulsant etc.  Adding, changing, or increasing the \\nintensity of psychotherapy may be considered for patients \\nwho do not respond to medication treatment. Following any \\nchange in treatment, close monitoring need to be done. If at \\nleast a moderate level of improvement in depressive symptoms \\nis not seen after an additional 4–8 weeks of treatment, another \\nthorough review need to be done. This reappraisal may include \\nverifying the patient’s diagnosis and adherence; identifying and \\naddressing clinical factors that may be preventing improvement, \\nsuch as the presence of comorbid general medical conditions \\nor psychiatric conditions (e.g., alcohol or substance abuse); \\nand identifying and addressing psychosocial issues that may \\nbe impeding recovery. If no new information is uncovered to'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/clinical_practice_guidelines_for_the_management_of.11.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='or psychiatric conditions (e.g., alcohol or substance abuse); \\nand identifying and addressing psychosocial issues that may \\nbe impeding recovery. If no new information is uncovered to \\nexplain the patient’s lack of adequate response, depending on \\nthe severity of depression, ECT maybe considered. \\nChoice of a specific psychotherapy:  Out of the various \\npsychotherapeutic interventions used for management \\nof depression, there is robust level of evidence for use of \\nCBT. The major determinants of type of psychotherapy \\nare patient preference and the availability of clinicians \\nwith appropriate training and expertise in specific \\npsychotherapeutic approaches. Other clinical factors which \\nwill influence the type of psychotherapy include the severity \\nof the depression. Psychotherapy is usually recommended \\nfor patients with depression who are experiencing stressful \\nlife events, interpersonal conflicts, family conflicts, poor \\nsocial support and comorbid personality issues.\\nThe optimal frequency of psychotherapy may be based on \\nspecific type and goals of the psychotherapy, the frequency \\nnecessary to create and maintain a therapeutic relationship, \\nthe frequency of visits required to ensure treatment \\nadherence, and the frequency necessary to monitor and \\naddress suicidality. Other factors which would also determine \\nthe frequency of psychotherapy visits include the severity \\nof illness, the patient’s cooperation with treatment, the \\navailability of social supports, cost, geographic accessibility, \\nand presence of comorbid general medical problems. \\nBesides the use of specific psychotherapy, all patients and their \\ncaregivers may receive psychoeducation about the illness. \\nRole of Yoga and Meditation in management of \\ndepression: Studies related to role of traditional therapies \\nlike meditation, Yoga and other techniques have been \\nmostly published in documents of various organizations \\npropagating that particular technique.

This is offset by a compensatory increase in the rate of \\nhepatic metabolism, and this is especially important for drugs with low intrinsic clearance.\\n•  Most antidepressants are highly lipid‑soluble and require hepatic metabolism (biotransformation into more polar \\ncompounds) to allow them to be cleared from the body in urine or bile.\\n•  Antidepressants can also be divided into two major categories of clearance, determined by their enzyme affinity. \\nFlow‑limited drugs have high hepatic extraction, and their hepatic clearance is dependent on the rate of delivery of \\nthe drug to the liver. TCAs undergo significant first pass metabolism of greater than 50% after oral administration.\\n•  Drugs with low hepatic‑enzyme affinity (e.g., paroxetine) are metabolized more slowly, as enzyme saturation is the \\nrate limiting step. The severity of impairment rather than the underlying aetiology is the most important factor to \\nconsider in prescribing for this group. Renal function may also be af fected.\\n•  As the risk of drug toxicity increases with disease severity, lower starting and total doses of medication are \\nrecommended (starting dose ‑about one forth that of adults). \\nRenal disease • In this group of patients, TCAs are probably safer than SSRIs.\\n• The degree of renal impairment rather than the cause is most important.\\n•  Renal impairment may be present without a raised creatinine level. TCAs metabolites are excreted by the kidneys, \\nhence accumulation may occur. Of the SSRIs, sertraline is not recommended by its manufacturers in renal failure.\\n•  Fluoxetine, citalopram and paroxetine may be started at very low dose in patients with a glomerular filtration rate \\nof at least>10 ml/min.\\n•  Lithium may only be prescribed if absolutely necessary, at low doses, on alternate days, with frequent checking of \\nserum levels.\\nPerioperative period •  TCAs may preferably be stopped prior to surgery. SSRIs and MAOI can interact with pethidine, pentazocine, and \\ndextromethorphan, at the pharmacodynamics levels and lead to serotonin syndrome, therefore such drugs may be \\navoided during the perioperative period. However, SSRIs may not be discontinued in order to prevent anesthetic \\ninteractions, except when the SSRI is used in combination with aspirin or an Non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory \\ndrugs and when the SSRI is used in patients over 80 years of age. In these patients, the balance of risks of \\nwithdrawal and bleeding is to be discussed with patients. Because abrupt discontinuation can cause serious \\nwithdrawal symptoms, the drugs may be gradually discontinued over few days to 2 weeks before surgery.\\n•  Lithium can contribute to hemodynamic instabilities, interfere with sodium and potassium metabolism, and the \\nrenal excretion of lithium can be reduced in presence of renal complications. The physical risk of intoxication, \\nwith its detrimental and fatal risks for the central nervous system, is unacceptable. Therefore, lithium \\ndiscontinuation is recommended. Lithium can be stopped at once because no withdrawal symptoms occur.\\n•  When, postoperatively, the patient is hemodynamically stable, is able and allowed to drink, and is not on new, \\npotentially interfering drugs, the medication may be restarted gradually.\\nantidepressant medication discontinuation syndromes. \\nDiscontinuation syndromes have been found to be more'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/presteddy56/resources/clinical_practice_guidelines_for_the_management_of.11.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='potentially interfering drugs, the medication may be restarted gradually.\\nantidepressant medication discontinuation syndromes. \\nDiscontinuation syndromes have been found to be more \\nfrequent after discontinuation of medications with shorter \\nhalf-lives, and patients maintained on short-acting agents \\nmay be given even longer, more gradual tapering.
